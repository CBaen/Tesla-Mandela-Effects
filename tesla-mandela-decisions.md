- **2026-02-13** | Created EPISODE_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md as the single authoritative writing guide | 50+ previous versions of writing/editing rules existed across 28 files. All are now superseded by this one document (~260 lines, XML-tagged for Opus 4.6). Replaces all files in the 2. WRITER AND EDITOR INSTRUCTIONS folder.
- **2026-02-13** | Episodes written in 3-5 multi-pass system, not single-pass | Research confirmed quality degrades past 4,000-6,000 words in single generation. Sweet spot is 3,000-5,000 words per pass. 3-5 passes per episode. Each pass gets full guidelines + brief + all prior output. No word counts per section.
- **2026-02-13** | Tesla must remain ambiguous - not villain, not willing collaborator | Guiding Light's explicit creative choice: Tesla 'cannot stop, even if he wanted to.' Respects Tesla as real historical figure. Removed 'he prefers this' thesis. Protects from Tesla purist listeners. Maintains mystery.
- **2026-02-13** | Temperature NOT codified as emotional signal | Guiding Light rejected temperature mapping (cold=alien, heat=assault). Would create cloning across episodes. Each episode finds its own sensory vocabulary.
- **2026-02-13** | Fabricated sources are the format, not a flaw | Three evidence layers: Layer 1 (verifiable facts with real names), Layer 2 (unverifiable fiction with documentary texture), Layer 3 (speculative questions). The blend IS the series identity. Real facts hook research-minded listeners; fabricated sources fill gaps.
- **2026-02-13** | Name economy cap of 6 retired, replaced with purpose-driven naming | Real historical figures get names (invites research). Recurring characters get names. One-off witnesses and fabricated characters get descriptions ('the midwife'). Concern is emotional misdirection, not pronunciation.
- **2026-02-13** | Episodes are standalone, non-chronological | Originally planned as chronological series. Changed to standalone episodes. Any episode can be a listener's first. No 'previously on.' Each episode is its own complete investigation.
- **2026-02-13** | Opus 4.6 instruction format: XML tags + Markdown hybrid, under 300 lines | Research confirmed: XML tags for behavioral directives, Markdown for organization. Examples near-authoritative. Positive framing over negative. Motivation with every rule. Critical rules at top AND bottom (U-shaped attention). Every added rule degrades all rules uniformly.
