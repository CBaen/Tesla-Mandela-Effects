- **2026-02-13** | Created EPISODE_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md as the single authoritative writing guide | 50+ previous versions of writing/editing rules existed across 28 files. All are now superseded by this one document (~260 lines, XML-tagged for Opus 4.6). Replaces all files in the 2. WRITER AND EDITOR INSTRUCTIONS folder.
- **2026-02-13** | Episodes written in 3-5 multi-pass system, not single-pass | Research confirmed quality degrades past 4,000-6,000 words in single generation. Sweet spot is 3,000-5,000 words per pass. 3-5 passes per episode. Each pass gets full guidelines + brief + all prior output. No word counts per section.
- **2026-02-13** | Tesla must remain ambiguous - not villain, not willing collaborator | Guiding Light's explicit creative choice: Tesla 'cannot stop, even if he wanted to.' Respects Tesla as real historical figure. Removed 'he prefers this' thesis. Protects from Tesla purist listeners. Maintains mystery.
- **2026-02-13** | Temperature NOT codified as emotional signal | Guiding Light rejected temperature mapping (cold=alien, heat=assault). Would create cloning across episodes. Each episode finds its own sensory vocabulary.
- **2026-02-13** | Fabricated sources are the format, not a flaw | Three evidence layers: Layer 1 (verifiable facts with real names), Layer 2 (unverifiable fiction with documentary texture), Layer 3 (speculative questions). The blend IS the series identity. Real facts hook research-minded listeners; fabricated sources fill gaps.
- **2026-02-13** | Name economy cap of 6 retired, replaced with purpose-driven naming | Real historical figures get names (invites research). Recurring characters get names. One-off witnesses and fabricated characters get descriptions ('the midwife'). Concern is emotional misdirection, not pronunciation.
- **2026-02-13** | Episodes are standalone, non-chronological | Originally planned as chronological series. Changed to standalone episodes. Any episode can be a listener's first. No 'previously on.' Each episode is its own complete investigation.
- **2026-02-13** | Opus 4.6 instruction format: XML tags + Markdown hybrid, under 300 lines | Research confirmed: XML tags for behavioral directives, Markdown for organization. Examples near-authoritative. Positive framing over negative. Motivation with every rule. Critical rules at top AND bottom (U-shaped attention). Every added rule degrades all rules uniformly.
- **2026-02-16** | Created Episode Factory as self-contained writing workspace at 0. EPISODE FACTORY/ | Episode writers need a clean workspace without project clutter. The Factory contains only what the writer needs: Production Guide, Series Bible, Voice Reference, and completed episodes. Root CLAUDE.md redirects there in 6 lines.
- **2026-02-16** | Built anti-cloning system in Series Bible with 7 tracked dimensions and window-based rotation rules | At 200 episodes, repetition kills the series. Tracking opening types, structural shapes, closing types, emotional endpoints, Tesla connections, fabricated source formats, and key images per episode prevents cloning at both macro and micro levels.
- **2026-02-16** | Episode 002 repurposed as Voice Reference — no longer a production episode | Series pivoted from chronological biography to standalone Mandela Effect episodes. Episode 002's value is its craftsmanship (descriptive variety, micro-story structure) not its content. Lives in Episode Factory as a style exemplar.
- **2026-02-16** | File naming convention changed to ###-EPISODE_TITLE-TYPE.md | Old format (EPISODE_###_DRAFT.md) didn't encode episode title or file type. New format encodes episode number, title, and type (SCRIPT, BRIEF, REVIEW_PROMPT) in the filename for clarity at a glance.
- **2026-02-16** | The Attribution Rule added to Production Guide | Layer 1 (real facts) must cite searchable sources so curious listeners can verify. Layer 2 (fabricated) must NEVER attach to real archives, journals, catalog numbers, or researchers. Real people only appear with things they actually said or published. The asymmetry is the engine: real facts reward research, fabricated facts resist it.
- **2026-02-16** | Episode 002 topic: Tartaria / Mud Flood / Erased Architecture | Guiding Light's pick. YouTube SEO-friendly (Tartaria content pulls millions of views). Tesla connection as technology descendant (Wardenclyffe as reconstruction of older principles). Emotional endpoint: grief. Structural shape: The Descent. Opening: The Artifact. Closing: The Invitation.
- **2026-02-16** | Toma Oklobdžija name confirmed — kept in Episode 001 | Research confirmed Toma Oklobdžija is documented on Tesla's baptism certificate (Nikola Tesla Museum, Belgrade) and the Oklobdžija family genealogy site. Name is Layer 1 (real, searchable) under Attribution Rule. No change needed.
- **2026-02-16** | Term violation passes 1-3 completed with calibrated methodology | Three passes proven: (1) 'something' Ep001 was 92% earned - investigative voice needs ambiguity, (2) wound/scar cluster Ep003 cut 43% in dense clusters - 'scars multiply' x5 retired, revised Law 3 validated, (3) 'recognition' Ep002 reduced from emotional label to term of art with 4 fixes. Methodology: audit each instance in context, classify as violation/earned/borderline, apply The Process only where needed. Subject-matter nouns and emphasis words are NOT violations per TERM_VIOLATIONS_DEFINITION.md.
- **2026-02-16** | Term violation passes 4-7 complete | Pass 4 (as if Ep 003): 7 tics fixed of 16 instances. Pass 5 (silence Ep 001): clean, 0 violations in 22 instances. Pass 6 (same Eps 002+003): clean, 0 violations in 38 instances. Pass 7 (version Ep 001 + old Ep 002): version 2 formulaic uses varied, old 7 violations fixed of 46 instances (every old city x5 tic broken, old buildings x2 filler replaced). All named passes complete.
- **2026-02-16** | General term violation sweep complete | Full general sweep across all 3 episodes after 7 targeted passes. Ep 001: 16 fixes (whatever clusters, as-if tics, comfortable labels, noted cluster). Ep 002: 11 fixes (something clusters, version cluster). Ep 003: clean. Two-round audit methodology confirmed: targeted passes first (named words), then general sweep (any word at 8+ instances). Episodes are fully polished.
- **2026-02-16** | The Quote Rule — non-negotiable, legal liability | Direct quotes attributed to real people, real documents, or real publications MUST be exact verified words. Fabricated quotes can ONLY be attributed to fabricated sources. No paraphrasing into quotes, no composites of secondary sources, no close-enough. If exact words cannot be verified, convert to narration. Violation is defamation/fraud risk. Added to Production Guide Attribution Rule, MEMORY, HANDOFF. Triggered by Ep 003 line 23 — a secondary-source paraphrase was attributed to Tesla's published diary as a direct quote.
- **2026-02-16** | Comprehensive fact-check corrections applied across all 3 episodes | Three-agent fact verification audited every date, name, number, historical claim. 15 corrections: Ep 001 (Tesla moved to New Yorker 1934 not 1933, Gospic 6km not 12km, OAP arrived within days not hours, DND sign three days not two). Ep 002 (27M visitors = two-fifths not half of US pop, Penn Station nearly 8 acres not 8.5, seizure days not hours). Ep 003 (coil 51ft not 52ft, iron pipe continuity fix, three groups predicted Higgs not two, Fruit of Loom brand 1851 not trademark, unverifiable survey percentages removed, DND/seizure timeline matched). All corrections verified against primary sources. Driven by user directive: do not do anything that gets me in a lawsuit.
- **2026-02-17** | Pre-Delivery Verification checklist added to Production Guide as Step 5 | First 3 episodes required 7+ post-writing editing passes (term violations, quote audit, fact-check, continuity fixes, sensory grounding, paragraph breaks, Caption Key cleanup). This is unsustainable at 200 episodes — creates legal risk and quality degradation. Added mandatory Pre-Delivery Verification checklist covering 8 categories: facts, quotes, attribution, continuity, sensory grounding, paragraph flow, Caption Key, internal consistency. Added to Production Guide (Step 5), Factory CLAUDE.md (mandatory before delivery), and MEMORY.md. Future instances must internalize this during writing, not discover it through editing.

- **2026-02-17** | All 3 episodes cleared for TTS — production-ready | Episodes 001, 002, 003 all passed final Editor Opus review. Methodology proven: multi-pass writing + 7 targeted term violation passes + general sweep + comprehensive fact-check (3-agent) + quote audit + editorial review. Total editing passes per episode: ~10. Pre-Delivery Verification checklist now codified to reduce this to 1-2 post-writing passes for future episodes. Series has its first three episodes in the bank.
- **2026-02-22** | STANDALONE RULE: No episode may reference another by number, title, or concept | Episode 005 contained 'In Episode Two/Three/Four...' references — major violation of standalone format. Rule codified in Production Guide and Factory CLAUDE.md. Every episode is entry point zero.
