# QUICK RULES
*The 10 most common violations - check these first*

---

## 1. SPECULATIVE BRIDGE (Most Important)

**FACTS = Definite. INTERPRETATION = Questions.**

✅ GOOD: "The paper is warped. The ink sits heavy. Had the priest's hand been shaking?"
❌ BAD: "The death was an erasure. The universe had identified the wrong anchor."

**Ratio:** 3 facts → 1 question → 3 facts → 1 question

---

## 2. INVISIBLE NARRATOR

**No "we discovered," "I believe," "let's go to"**

✅ GOOD: "A letter surfaced in the archive decades later."
❌ BAD: "We discovered a letter in the archive."

**Exception:** "We are here to examine..." (mission statement) is allowed.

---

## 3. TERM FREQUENCY (2-Use Cap)

Each medical/body term: **maximum 2 times per episode**

Track: infection, fever, tissue, scar, body, wound, graft, rejection

**After 2 uses:** Replace with visceral DESCRIPTION, not synonyms.

---

## 4. DESCRIPTION OVER TERMINOLOGY

**Show what happens. Don't name it.**

✅ GOOD: "The body recognized the foreign tissue and attacked—white cells swarming, inflammation spreading like fire."
❌ BAD: "The graft-versus-host response initiated cytotoxic activity."

---

## 5. PRONOUN AVALANCHE

**Re-anchor the name every 2-3 sentences**

✅ GOOD: "She looked at the basin. She saw it vibrating. Marta didn't understand..."
❌ BAD: "She looked. She saw. She described. She refused. She cut. She washed. She told. She called. She believed."

---

## 6. NAME ECONOMY

**≤6 unusual names per episode**

One-time characters don't need names: "The night watchman," "A researcher at Belgrade."

Names earn their place through: substantial testimony, emotional weight, or return appearances.

---

## 7. OPENING HOOK

**First sentence = vertigo or wrongness. No dates. No locations.**

✅ GOOD: "The body wasn't even cold yet."
✅ GOOD: "The midwife refused to hold the child."
❌ BAD: "In eighteen fifty-six, in a village called Smiljan..."

---

## 8. MAJOR TRANSITIONS (Breath Paragraphs)

**Time/location jumps need full reorientation:**

1. Signal the shift
2. Name the location
3. Establish date/time
4. Sensory grounding (2-3 details)
5. Introduce the focus

❌ BAD: "Meanwhile, in Siberia, something was happening."

---

## 9. MICRO-FACT VERIFICATION

**Before finalizing, verify:**
- Ages (calculate from birth year)
- Directions (check map)
- Relationships (nephew ≠ cousin)
- Technical claims (particles move, not magnets)

---

## 10. "YOU" DENSITY

**Save "you" for the ending.**

- Maximum 35 "you/your" per episode
- 80% should be in the final section (Prognosis)
- No more than 8 before Metastasis section

---
