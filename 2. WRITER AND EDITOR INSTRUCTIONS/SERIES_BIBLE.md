# Tesla Mandela Effects — Series Bible
## Anti-Cloning Registry

This file prevents episode cloning. Before writing any episode brief, the writer MUST read this file and ensure the new episode does not duplicate:
- The same closing type as the previous 3 episodes
- The same Tesla connection type as the previous 2 episodes
- Any Mandela Effect that was a PRIMARY feature in the last 5 episodes
- The same fabricated source format used in the previous episode
- The same emotional thesis as any episode in the last 5

Mandela Effects and Tesla experiments CAN recur as passing references or brief mentions — they just cannot be the central anchor again within the window above.

## Closing Types (rotate — never use the same type twice in a row)

1. **The Mirror** — Final question turns the listener into the subject ("are you the scar?")
2. **The Open Wound** — Investigation ends mid-sentence, unresolved, as if the file is still open
3. **The Callback** — Final line echoes the opening hook, transformed by everything learned
4. **The Witness** — Closing is a fabricated testimony that reframes the entire episode
5. **The Inversion** — The "safe" explanation turns out to be more terrifying than the conspiracy
6. **The Silence** — The investigation reaches a point where there is nothing left to say, and says so
7. **The Invitation** — Listener is given a specific action (look something up, check something physical)

## Tesla Connection Types (vary across episodes)

1. **Direct appearance** — Tesla is a character in the episode, with scenes and dialogue
2. **Experiment consequence** — Tesla's specific experiment caused or enabled the anomaly
3. **Technology descendant** — Modern technology unknowingly continues Tesla's work
4. **Philosophical parallel** — Tesla's IDEAS (not experiments) illuminate the anomaly
5. **Absence** — Tesla's MISSING work (seized papers, lost notebooks) is the connection
6. **Opposition** — Someone or something worked to UNDO what Tesla started

## Fabricated Source Formats (never repeat the same format in consecutive episodes)

- Classified internal memo
- Geological/environmental survey
- Monitoring station log with handwritten annotation
- Anonymous letter from insider/whistleblower
- Declassified government report (partially redacted)
- Personal diary or journal entry
- Oral history / recorded interview transcript
- Institutional correspondence (university, military, corporate)
- Unpublished academic paper
- Photographic evidence with provenance gaps
- Court testimony or deposition
- Insurance claim or incident report

## Episode Registry

### 003 — THE GOD PARTICLE
- **Wound:** CERN Large Hadron Collider and Mandela Effects
- **Tesla connection type:** Experiment consequence (Colorado Springs frequency → CERN unknowingly continues the resonance work)
- **Tesla presence:** Direct appearance (Colorado Springs 1899, Wardenclyffe 1901-1917, death 1943)
- **Key locations:** Colorado Springs, Shoreham/Long Island, CERN/Meyrin, New Yorker Hotel Manhattan
- **Key experiments:** Colorado Springs magnifying transmitter, Wardenclyffe Tower, LHC particle collisions
- **Mandela Effects (primary):** Berenstain Bears, Fruit of the Loom cornucopia, Monopoly Man monocle, "Luke I am your father"
- **Fabricated sources:** Classified internal memo (Frequency Discrepancy Report), geological survey (Colorado Springs soil), monitoring station log (Schumann Deviation Log, Tromsø), anonymous insider letter (calibration engineer)
- **Closing type:** The Mirror — listener asked if they are the scar, the residue of an overwritten version
- **Emotional thesis:** Your memories are physical evidence of surgery, not cognitive failure
- **Structural shape:** Chronological spiral (1899 → present, with each pass adding a new evidence layer)
- **Unique elements:** July 4th date synchronicity (Wardenclyffe demolition / Higgs discovery — 95 years), Nataraja/Shiva statue at CERN, Higgs field as "what decides what has substance," Elizabeth Loftus false memory counter-argument as structural pivot, 8 Hz frequency as through-line motif
- **Names spent:** Nikola Tesla, Peter Higgs, Francois Englert, Robert Brout, Fabiola Gianotti, Joe Incandela, Leon Lederman, Winfried Otto Schumann, Guglielmo Marconi, J.P. Morgan, Fiona Broome, Elizabeth Loftus, John G. Trump, Felix Bloch, James Earl Jones, Stan and Jan Berenstain
