Tesla Mandela Effects — Series Concept Summary

The Central Premise
Reality is not a simulation—it's a living biological organism. And it's infected.
Nikola Tesla's birth on July 10, 1856, wasn't just the arrival of a genius. It was an incision—a wound in the fabric of the timeline through which something foreign entered. The series treats Tesla not as an unwitting vessel, but as an enthusiastic host. He remembers where he came from. He approves of the changes. His inventions aren't discoveries—they're transmissions, deliberately grafting physics from his origin point onto our reality.

The Mandela Effects
The memory anomalies we call "Mandela Effects"—Berenstain vs. Berenstein, the missing cornucopia, misremembered movie quotes—aren't failures of human cognition. They're residue. Fossil records of a timeline being overwritten. People who remember "wrong" are carrying fragments of the original world the surgery is trying to delete.

Format & Tone
The series relies heavily on biological references (infection, rejection, wound, scar)—over tech language (glitch, code, simulation). This is not an absolutely rule, but a general style preference and guide. A 3:1 ratio of documented historical fact to speculative question. An invisible narrator presenting evidence, never claiming identity.

The horror isn't that Tesla was invaded. The horror is that he prefers this.
