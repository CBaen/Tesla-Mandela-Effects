1. THE HUNT: Give the listener something to search for.
   "Find a photo of yourself as a child. Look at the sky. What color is the sun?"

2. THE WITNESS BURDEN: The listener knows too much.
   "They think it's always been this way. You know better."

3. THE RESIDUE: The listener is proof.
   "You are the fossil record. You are proof that something was lost."

4. THE NEXT MYSTERY: Forward momentum.
   "We need to look at what he saw in those shadows."

5. THE UNANSWERED QUESTION: Philosophical vertigo.
   "If the Lion was always a Wolf, what else have we been misremembering?"

6. THE OBSERVER: Something is watching.
   "The light is getting brighter. Bright lights are for examination."

7. THE ANCHOR CALL: Solidarity.
   "You are not alone. There are others who remember. Find them."
