## What Happened This Session (2026-02-22)

Episode 004 "The Tesla Brothers" — COMPLETE AND ACCEPTED. Final word count: ~10,022 words.

Written across Sessions 1-4, then finalized with 3 editorial review rounds:

- Session 2: Expanded to ~11,585 words, first editor reviews applied

- Session 4: 3 editorial fixes + 13 term violation fixes + 2 attribution fixes (~10,022 words)

Final fixes this session:
- **Editorial**: OAP speculation cut, bio-metaphor restored ("Thought as organism"), closing softened to question
- **Term violations**: 13 fixes (feel/felt, watched, vague "something," silence clusters)
- **Attribution**: "Zagreb Folklore Archive" → generic descriptor (Attribution Rule), "direct symptom" → conditional framing (Law 5)
- **Workflow rules codified**: Factory CLAUDE.md updated with ONE SESSION ONE EPISODE workflow expectations

## What's Next
- **Episode 004 is COMPLETE AND ACCEPTED** — ~10,022 words, all reviews passed
- **ALL FOUR EPISODES (001-004) now production-ready for TTS**
- **Choose topic for Episode 005** — Check Series Bible for anti-cloning constraints
- Episodes 001-003 remain production-ready

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there, including workflow expectations
- **ONE SESSION, ONE EPISODE.** Brief → writing passes (subagents) → verification (subagent) → commit. No handoffs.
- **The Process** is a permanent writing rule. Located at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/The Process- How to Rewrite Term Violations.txt`.
- **Law 3 was rewritten.** Bio metaphor is a mode of description, not a word count.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **THE QUOTE RULE (CRITICAL/LEGAL):** Direct quotes attributed to real people must be exact, verified words. Fabricated quotes ONLY to fabricated sources.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
