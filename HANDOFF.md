# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-16)

Wrote Episode 003 "The God Particle" (CERN/Mandela Effects), built the Episode Factory workspace, and created the anti-cloning system for scalable episode production.

### Episode 003 — Complete
- **Topic:** CERN Large Hadron Collider and Mandela Effects
- **Location:** `0. EPISODE FACTORY/EPISODES/003 - THE GOD PARTICLE/`
- Written in 4 passes, ~95 paragraphs, ~9,600 words
- Three external AI reviews (Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) — all rated strong with minor fixes
- Fixes applied: removed "sternum" anatomy shortcuts (Law 2), softened declarations into questions (Law 5), expanded Mandela Effects for individual weight, broke long paragraphs for audio breathing, sharpened closing to land on listener personally
- Added Breath Paragraph protocol to Production Guide (date-first transitions for image production pipeline)

### Episode Factory — Built
Created `0. EPISODE FACTORY/` as self-contained episode writing workspace:
- `CLAUDE.md` — Front door with read order and job description
- `PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md` — The five laws and writing rules (~287 lines)
- `SERIES_BIBLE.md` — Anti-cloning registry with menus and episode entries
- `VOICE_REFERENCE.txt` — Episode 002 as style exemplar (not production episode)
- `EPISODES/` — All completed episode drafts and briefs

### Anti-Cloning System — Built
Series Bible now tracks seven dimensions per episode to prevent repetition:
- **Opening types** (7 options) — prevents "Have you ever...?" from anchoring every episode
- **Structural shapes** (8 options) — prevents chronological spiral as the only architecture
- **Closing types** (7 options) — prevents same ending type twice in a row
- **Emotional endpoints** (8 options) — prevents existential dread as the only landing
- **Tesla connection types** (6 options) — forces variety in how Tesla connects to each topic
- **Fabricated source formats** (12 options) — prevents same document type in consecutive episodes
- **Key images per episode** (10 per entry) — prevents distinctive metaphors from recurring within 3 episodes

### Project Reorganization
- Root CLAUDE.md is now a clean 6-line redirect to Episode Factory
- Old scripts moved to `1. EPISODE SCRIPTS/Old Scripts/`
- Old `1. EPISODE DRAFTS/` folder deleted
- Old editor requirements cleaned up
- Episode 002 repurposed as Voice Reference (style exemplar, not production episode)

## What's Next
- Choose topic for Episode 004 and write it using the full system
- The system is ready for production — all guardrails in place

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing any brief.** Pick different choices from the menus. Check key images from recent episodes.
- **Guiding Light is a designer, not a coder.** Explain in outcomes, not implementation.
