# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-22, Sessions 2-3)

Episode 004 "The Tesla Brothers" expanded, edited, surgically revised, and verified. Now PRODUCTION-READY at ~10,098 words.

### Session 3 — Surgical Edits (Post-Editor Review)
Two external editor reviews (Opus 4.6, GPT 5.2) agreed the expansion pass solved 3 problems but introduced 4 new ones. 10 surgical edits applied:
- **Law 3 fixes** (3 instances): "organism" named directly → replaced with process-description language ("What requires two minds cannot survive on one," "Two minds as one," "thought spreading through language")
- **Law 2 fix**: Cholera section (~700 words → ~170 words) — cut medical anatomy violations ("lips crack, eyes sink into skull"), kept fever vision + Milutin bargain as narrated summary
- **Law 1 fixes** (2 instances): "this episode" → "this investigation" narrator identity leaks removed
- **Attribution fix**: Milutin's dramatized bargain scene → narrated summary (no interior access to real people)
- **Gospic cut**: 3 paragraphs removed — house description, grave distance, parishioners interior access ("white-hot pressure burning inside the vault of his skull")
- **OAP speculation cut**: 2 paragraphs of letter-content speculation removed — original silence was stronger
- **Closing shift**: Assertive "You are listening to learn about yourself" → invitational "Have you ever reached for someone who was not there?" (Law 5 compliance)
- **Repetition fixes**: Duplicate "But he built it alone" refrain removed; evidence summary trimmed
- **Factual softening**: "remembered nothing of his brother" → "could not recall his brother clearly" (contradicted Tesla's superlative descriptions)

Net result: ~11,585 → ~10,098 words. All cuts improved the script.

### Session 2 — Expansion Pass + First Editor Reviews
Script expanded from ~8,492 to ~11,585 words via 4 strategic insertions:
1. **Gospic sensory grounding** (~400 words) — garrison town atmosphere, Milutin's visible aging
2. **Cholera scene** (~700 words) — disease progression, fever visions, deathbed bargain
3. **Colorado Springs & Wardenclyffe** (~500 words) — magnifying transmitter, artificial lightning, tower demolition
4. **OAP inventory discovery** (~350 words) — yellowed pages, typewriter degradation, "D. Tesla" mystery

First editor reviews (Gemini 3.0, GPT 5.2, Claude 4.6) applied:
- Factual fixes, attribution fixes, craft fixes, audio pacing improvements

Post-expansion cleanup: duplicate paragraphs removed, orphaned Caption Key entry removed.

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **Use subagents for writing passes.** Main context is for coordination and verification only.
- **The Process** is a permanent writing rule. Located at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/The Process- How to Rewrite Term Violations.txt`.
- **Law 3 was rewritten.** Bio metaphor is a mode of description, not a word count.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **THE QUOTE RULE (CRITICAL/LEGAL):** Direct quotes attributed to real people must be exact, verified words. Fabricated quotes ONLY to fabricated sources.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
- **Term Violations Definition** at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/TERM_VIOLATIONS_DEFINITION.md`. Three categories.
