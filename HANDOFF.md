# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-16)

Episode 002 "The Buried Floor" — written, peer reviewed (three-way: Gemini, Perplexity, Claude), and revised. Ready for TTS production.

### Episode 002 — "The Buried Floor" — Revised and ready
- **Location:** `0. EPISODE FACTORY/EPISODES/002 - THE BURIED FLOOR/`
- **Word count:** ~9,200 words, 120 paragraphs (trimmed from ~10K after closing tightened per editorial review)
- **Topic:** Tartaria / Mud Flood / Erased Architecture
- Written in 3 passes, then revised after three-way peer review + Opus 4.6 editorial pass

#### Revision Pass (applied this session)
- **7 factual corrections (Layer 1):** Singer Building address (65→149 Broadway), dome diameter (55→68 feet), Wardenclyffe pipes (16 feet→300 feet deep), Singer demolition record (past tense — surpassed by 270 Park Ave 2019), Penn Station columns (pink granite→travertine marble for interior Corinthian), Seattle grade raise (12-30→12-22 feet), Lake Street block (half-acre→nearly a full acre)
- **3 mechanical fixes:** Double commas→ellipses (TTS), Law 2 body violation removed ("settled into the bodies of millions"→"settled into millions"), Galveston beat/paragraph break added
- **9 grief term violations fixed:** "Grief" appeared 11 times. Kept 3 (lines 13, 123, 209). Replaced 8 with specific images per The Process (weight, accusation, phantom weight, recognition, loss, silence, ache, wound)
- **Closing trimmed ~450 words:** Removed 7 paragraphs of recap/thesis restatement between recognition paragraph and final landing. Closing now drops from "you will carry that recognition" directly into "The evidence is not hidden. → It is beneath your feet. → Look down."
- **The Process** internalized as permanent writing rule (term violation replacement methodology)

### Files created this session
- `002-THE_BURIED_FLOOR-REVIEW_PROMPT.md` — 24-question peer review prompt covering factual accuracy, voice/craft, structure, TTS, and attribution

### Previous Session Work (preserved)
- Episode 001 "Arriving from Between" — complete and shipped (~9,700 words)
- Episode 003 "The God Particle" — complete
- Episode Factory — built and operational
- Anti-cloning system — tested across 3 episodes
- The Attribution Rule — added to Production Guide
- File naming convention: `###-EPISODE_TITLE-TYPE.md`

## What's Next
- **Episode 002 is ready for TTS production** — all peer review corrections applied
- **Choose topic for Episode 004** — Check Series Bible for anti-cloning constraints
- Continue building the episode library toward 100-200 standalone episodes

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **The Process** is now a permanent writing rule. Term violations = emotional labels repeated instead of building distinct images. Located at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/The Process- How to Rewrite Term Violations.txt`
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **The Attribution Rule** is in the Production Guide. Real facts = searchable. Fabricated facts = uncheckable. Never mix.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
- **File naming:** `###-EPISODE_TITLE-TYPE.md` (SCRIPT, BRIEF, REVIEW_PROMPT)
- **Peer review works.** Three-way (Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) + Opus 4.6 editorial pass. Apply fixes surgically.
- **Guiding Light is a designer, not a coder.** Explain in outcomes, not implementation.
