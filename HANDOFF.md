# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-16)

Three-episode audit completed. Critical fixes applied across all episodes. Law 3 rewritten. The Process integrated as permanent writing rule.

### Critical Fixes Applied (all three episodes)

**Episode 002 "The Buried Floor":**
- Manufactures Building: 65,000 sq ft → 31 acres (was off by 20x)
- 1858 building location: "Lake Street" → "Randolph and Dearborn" (Lake St was Pullman's later project)
- "Grief" reduced from 6 to exactly 3 instances (line 209 had 4 alone, applied The Process)
- Closing trimmed ~450 words of recap/thesis restatement
- 7 factual corrections from peer review (Singer address, dome diameter, pipes, etc.)

**Episode 003 "The God Particle":**
- New Yorker Hotel: "33 floors" → "43 floors" (room 3327 was on floor 33)
- Attribution Rule: Removed "Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum" → "a regional museum's geological holdings"
- Attribution Rule: Removed "International Mandela Effect Conference" → "a conference devoted to collective memory anomalies"
- Wardenclyffe shaft: "60 feet" → "120-foot shaft, pipes 300 feet deeper"
- Englert age: "80" → "79" (turned 80 in November, announcement was July)

**Episode 001 "Arriving from Between":**
- Milutin Tesla: Fixed from "priest of neighboring parish" to "parish priest of Smiljan" (correct)
- Father Toma: Reframed as neighboring clergyman called to baptize (a priest does not baptize his own child)
- Father Toma name: RESOLVED — Toma Oklobdžija confirmed real (Tesla's baptism certificate, Nikola Tesla Museum Belgrade). Name kept.

### Law 3 Rewritten in Production Guide
- Old: "Maintain approximately 3:1 biological over technological language" (produced term-counting, not better writing)
- New: Biological metaphor is a MODE OF DESCRIPTION, not a vocabulary list. Describe biological processes in action using The Process methodology. Don't count ratios. Don't use synonyms. Describe what infection/rejection/scarring DOES without saying the word. Test: "Does this feel like a living system or a mechanical one?"

### Term Violation Passes Completed (3 of 6+)

**Pass 1: "Something" in Episode 001 (x27)**
- 92% legitimate (earned ambiguity — investigative voice needs unknowability)
- 2 replaced, 23 earned, 3 borderline kept
- Verdict: Episode 001's "something" count was a false alarm. The writing was sound.

**Pass 2: Wound/Scar cluster in Episode 003 (49 target labels)**
- 43% reduction in densest clusters
- "Scars multiply" x5 retired — five identical labels became five different descriptions
- Timeline (141-161): 13 labels → 0. Closing (191-201): 8 → 1 (earned declaration: "Or whether you are the scar")
- Repair paragraph and pathology paragraph cleaned. One description kept as conceptual anchor.
- Revised Law 3 proven functional — produces better writing, not just different writing.

**Pass 3: "Recognition" in Episode 002 (x14)**
- 4 replaced at climactic moments, 10 kept as term of art
- "Recognition" functions as the episode's name for the collective phenomenon (earned)
- Violations were at emotional moments where images should do the work, not labels

**Remaining for future passes (lower stakes, methodology locked in):**
- "As if" x11 (Ep 003) — half likely tics
- "Silence" x13+ (Ep 001) — structural uses fine, label uses need audit
- Borderlines: "old" (Ep 002), "same" (Eps 002/003), "version" (Ep 001)
- Scattered biological labels in Ep 003 first half (lines 11-119, low density)

### Documents Updated This Session
- All 3 episode scripts (critical fixes + term violation passes)
- Production Guide (Law 3 rewrite)
- Factory CLAUDE.md (The Process as item #2, Term Violations Definition as item #5)
- TERM_VIOLATIONS_DEFINITION.md — new file defining what is/isn't a term violation (3 categories)
- Review prompt created for Episode 002
- Series Bible registry (unchanged)

### Previous Session Work (preserved)
- Episode 001 "Arriving from Between" — complete (~9,700 words)
- Episode 002 "The Buried Floor" — revised and ready for TTS (~9,200 words)
- Episode 003 "The God Particle" — complete (~9,600 words)
- Episode Factory — built and operational
- Anti-cloning system — tested across 3 episodes

## What's Next
- ~~CHECK Toma research~~ **RESOLVED** — Toma Oklobdžija is confirmed real. Documented on Tesla's baptism certificate (Nikola Tesla Museum, Belgrade) and Oklobdžija family genealogy site. Name is Layer 1 (searchable). Kept as-is in Episode 001.
- **All 3 episodes improved** — factual fixes + 3 term violation passes complete
- **Choose topic for Episode 004** — Check Series Bible for anti-cloning constraints
- **Optional: remaining term violation passes** — "as if" (Ep 003), "silence" (Ep 001), borderlines. Lower stakes, methodology locked in.
- **Push to origin** — 11 commits ahead

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **The Process** is now a permanent writing rule. Located at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/The Process- How to Rewrite Term Violations.txt`. READ IT before writing.
- **Law 3 was rewritten.** Bio metaphor is a mode of description, not a word count. Describe living processes without labels.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **The Attribution Rule** is in the Production Guide. Real facts = searchable. Fabricated facts = uncheckable. NEVER name real archives/orgs for fabricated material.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
- **Term Violations Definition** is at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/TERM_VIOLATIONS_DEFINITION.md`. Three categories: violations (apply The Process), not violations (leave alone), earned ambiguity (judgment call). Subject-matter nouns, prepositions, and emphasis words are NOT violations.
- **Term violation passes methodology is proven.** Three passes completed. Results: "something" was 92% earned, biological labels needed 43% reduction in clusters, "recognition" needed only 4 fixes at emotional climaxes. The methodology is calibrated for future instances.
- **Peer review works.** Three-way (Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) + Opus 4.6 editorial pass.
- **Guiding Light is a designer, not a coder.** Explain in outcomes, not implementation.
