# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-13)

Built the definitive Episode Production Guide from scratch. This replaces 50+ previous versions of writing/editing rules that had accumulated contradictions, growing exception lists, and model-specific formatting.

### What Was Done
1. **Audited all 28 files** across `2. WRITER AND EDITOR INSTRUCTIONS\` — identified consistent rules, contradictions, and abandoned rules
2. **Analyzed Episode 001** (Arriving from Between) — established as the structural reference and narrator voice standard
3. **Analyzed Episode 002** (The Lion vs The Wolf) — established as the audio-first writing reference. Beautiful prose, wrong format (literary novella, not documentary). "Keep the body, change the bones."
4. **Resolved 5 key contradictions** with Guiding Light's creative input (see decisions log)
5. **Researched Opus 4.6 instruction compliance** — XML tags + Markdown hybrid, examples over rules, under 300 lines, U-shaped attention curve
6. **Researched long-form output quality** — multi-pass writing in 3,000-5,000 word chunks is optimal. Single-pass 10K+ degrades.
7. **Wrote and refined EPISODE_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md** (~260 lines) — Guiding Light reviewed and edited with their own examples and adjustments

### The Guide Is At
`C:\Users\baenb\Desktop\Tesla Mandela Effects\2. WRITER AND EDITOR INSTRUCTIONS\EPISODE_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md`

This is THE authoritative document. All other files in that folder are historical/superseded.

## What's Next
- **Test the guide with a real episode.** Create an Episode Brief, then write Pass 1 and evaluate whether the guide produces compliant, high-quality output.
- **Fix one remaining typo:** Line 120 has "they they" (double word)
- **Consider archiving or removing** the 27 other instruction files in that folder to prevent future instances from reading outdated rules

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** Do not attempt second drafts. They introduce inconsistencies, multiple endings, and expanded repetition. First draft must be right.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to." Respect the real person.
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Don't treat them as a problem to solve.
- **Term violations = lazy writing, not word counts.** The Process (in the guide) teaches how to think about replacement, not what frequency to target.
- **Guiding Light is a designer, not a coder.** Explain in outcomes, not implementation.
