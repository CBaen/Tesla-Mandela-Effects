# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-22)

Episode 004 "The Tesla Brothers" written and verified. Script at ~8,222 words (under 10,000 target but narratively complete). Series Bible updated with Episode 004 entry.

### Writing Process
- 3-pass subagent approach: each writing pass delegated to a general-purpose subagent with full reference files loaded in its own context window
- Pass 1: ~3,800 words (Opening + Movements 1-2)
- Pass 2: ~3,800 words (Movements 3-4, psychoanalyst notes + OAP inventory)
- Pass 3: ~2,600 words (Movement 5 Zagreb testimony + closing + Caption Key)
- Main context reserved for verification, fixes, and coordination

### Factual Errors Fixed Post-Writing
- Nikola's age in 1863: "three years old" → "seven years old" (born ~1856)
- "A boy who is five" → "A boy who is seven"
- Nikola's age for cholera (1873): "twenty-six" → "seventeen"
- Nikola's age in 1870: "eighteen" → "fourteen"
- University: "Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague" → "Austrian Polytechnic in Graz"
- Timeline: "by eighteen sixty-four/sixty-five" → "By September of eighteen sixty-three" (same year as death)
- Missing fabricated source: Djuka's letter manually inserted (4th of 4 from brief)
- Caption Key updated for all corrections + added "Mandic"

### Pre-Delivery Verification
- All facts checked, all quotes verified, all 4 fabricated sources present
- 134 paragraphs (well under 400 ElevenLabs limit)
- Cleared as production-ready despite word count being ~1,800 under minimum target

### Word Count Note
Script is ~8,222 words vs 10,000-13,000 target. Previous episodes: 001 (~9,700), 002 (~9,200), 003 (~9,600). Verification agent cleared it as narratively complete — all 5 movements present, all 4 fabricated sources woven in, closing turns to listener. **Guiding Light should decide: accept as-is or request an expansion pass.**

### Process Learning for Future Episodes
Two prior sessions were consumed loading reference files without producing script text. The successful approach:
1. Pre-load reference files in subagent context, not main context
2. 3 sequential writing passes of 3,000-5,000 words each
3. Keep verification and fixes in main context
4. For future improvement: compress reference files into a single instruction payload rather than having each subagent read all files independently

## Previous Session Summary (2026-02-17)

ALL THREE EPISODES (001-003) CLEARED FOR TTS. Production-ready. Final editorial reviews complete. Pre-Delivery Verification checklist codified. Term violation audit complete (7 targeted passes + general sweep). Quote Attribution Rule audit complete across all 3 episodes.

## What's Next
- **Episode 004 word count decision** — accept ~8,222 words or expand to hit 10,000 minimum
- **Choose topic for Episode 005** — Check Series Bible for anti-cloning constraints
- Episodes 001-003 remain production-ready for TTS

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **Use subagents for writing passes.** Main context is for coordination and verification only.
- **The Process** is a permanent writing rule. Located at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/The Process- How to Rewrite Term Violations.txt`.
- **Law 3 was rewritten.** Bio metaphor is a mode of description, not a word count.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **THE QUOTE RULE (CRITICAL/LEGAL):** Direct quotes attributed to real people must be exact, verified words. Fabricated quotes ONLY to fabricated sources.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
- **Term Violations Definition** at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/TERM_VIOLATIONS_DEFINITION.md`. Three categories.
