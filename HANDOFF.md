# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-16)

Three-episode audit completed. Critical fixes applied across all episodes. Law 3 rewritten. The Process integrated as permanent writing rule.

### Critical Fixes Applied (all three episodes)

**Episode 002 "The Buried Floor":**
- Manufactures Building: 65,000 sq ft → 31 acres (was off by 20x)
- 1858 building location: "Lake Street" → "Randolph and Dearborn" (Lake St was Pullman's later project)
- "Grief" reduced from 6 to exactly 3 instances (line 209 had 4 alone, applied The Process)
- Closing trimmed ~450 words of recap/thesis restatement
- 7 factual corrections from peer review (Singer address, dome diameter, pipes, etc.)

**Episode 003 "The God Particle":**
- New Yorker Hotel: "33 floors" → "43 floors" (room 3327 was on floor 33)
- Attribution Rule: Removed "Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum" → "a regional museum's geological holdings"
- Attribution Rule: Removed "International Mandela Effect Conference" → "a conference devoted to collective memory anomalies"
- Wardenclyffe shaft: "60 feet" → "120-foot shaft, pipes 300 feet deeper"
- Englert age: "80" → "79" (turned 80 in November, announcement was July)

**Episode 001 "Arriving from Between":**
- Milutin Tesla: Fixed from "priest of neighboring parish" to "parish priest of Smiljan" (correct)
- Father Toma: Reframed as neighboring clergyman called to baptize (a priest does not baptize his own child)
- Father Toma name: RESOLVED — Toma Oklobdžija confirmed real (Tesla's baptism certificate, Nikola Tesla Museum Belgrade). Name kept.

### Law 3 Rewritten in Production Guide
- Old: "Maintain approximately 3:1 biological over technological language" (produced term-counting, not better writing)
- New: Biological metaphor is a MODE OF DESCRIPTION, not a vocabulary list. Describe biological processes in action using The Process methodology. Don't count ratios. Don't use synonyms. Describe what infection/rejection/scarring DOES without saying the word. Test: "Does this feel like a living system or a mechanical one?"

### Term Violation Passes Completed (7 of 7)

**Pass 1: "Something" in Episode 001 (x27)**
- 92% legitimate (earned ambiguity — investigative voice needs unknowability)
- 2 replaced, 23 earned, 3 borderline kept
- Verdict: Episode 001's "something" count was a false alarm. The writing was sound.

**Pass 2: Wound/Scar cluster in Episode 003 (49 target labels)**
- 43% reduction in densest clusters
- "Scars multiply" x5 retired — five identical labels became five different descriptions
- Timeline (141-161): 13 labels → 0. Closing (191-201): 8 → 1 (earned declaration: "Or whether you are the scar")
- Repair paragraph and pathology paragraph cleaned. One description kept as conceptual anchor.
- Revised Law 3 proven functional — produces better writing, not just different writing.

**Pass 3: "Recognition" in Episode 002 (x14)**
- 4 replaced at climactic moments, 10 kept as term of art
- "Recognition" functions as the episode's name for the collective phenomenon (earned)
- Violations were at emotional moments where images should do the work, not labels

**Pass 4: "As if" in Episode 003 (x16)**
- 7 tics fixed, 7 earned narrative tools kept, 2 borderline kept
- Tics: sentence-initial "As if" used for dramatic emphasis where a direct statement or clause cut was stronger
- Earned: "as if" inside sentences creating genuine conditional tension (e.g., "as if the Earth's body had rejected the procedure")

**Pass 5: "Silence" in Episode 001 (x22)**
- Zero violations. All 22 instances are structural or subject-matter specific.
- "Silence" is the episode's central metaphor — witnesses choosing silence, village silence, institutional silence.
- Clean pass. No edits needed.

**Pass 6: "Same" in Episodes 002+003 (x38)**
- Zero violations. All 38 instances structural (parallel constructions, comparative arguments).
- Clean pass. No edits needed.

**Pass 7: Borderlines — "Version" (Ep 001), "Old" (Ep 002)**
- "Version" (Ep 001): 4 uses of "the accepted version" — 2 earned (establishing + closing), 2 formulaic. Fixed lines 217 and 241.
- "Old" (Ep 002): 46 instances — 29 not violations, 8 earned ambiguity, 7 violations (15%). Fixed all 7: "every old city" x5 (formulaic tic — varied each), "old buildings" x2 (filler modifier — replaced with specific images).

**All named term violation passes complete.**

### General Sweep (full audit, all 3 episodes)

After the 7 targeted passes, a general sweep audited every word at 8+ instances across all episodes — not targeting specific words, but looking for ANY remaining lazy labels or clustering.

**Episode 001:** 16 new violations found across 4 words:
- "Whatever" (x16): 6 violations — clusters on lines 221 and 227 reduced from 4→2 each. Third/fourth "whatever" in anaphoric lists converted to direct noun phrases.
- "As if" (x17): 5 violations — lines 137, 147, 167, 177, 207. Hedged comparisons converted to direct statements; stock phrase "as if nothing had changed" replaced.
- "Comfortable" (x5): 2 violations — third use in 12-line span (line 63) and fifth use (line 235). Varied to "nearest" and "permitted."
- "Noted" (x10): 3 violations — triple cluster on line 175 collapsed to varied verbs (noted/tracked/measured).

**Episode 002:** 11 new violations found across 2 words:
- "Something" (x26): 6 violations — "Something deeper. Something" cut and merged (line 15); "Something heavy. Something permanent." replaced with specific nouns (line 141); redundant second "something" replaced with "a principle" (line 199).
- "Version" (x9): 4 violations — 9 uses in 22-line cluster (lines 187-209). Varied 4 with "layer," "world," "reality," "order." Establishing and closing uses kept.

**Episode 003:** Clean. No new violations found. Previous passes caught everything. Scattered biological labels in first half confirmed as single uses doing specific metaphorical work.

### Documents Updated This Session
- All 3 episode scripts (critical fixes + term violation passes)
- Production Guide (Law 3 rewrite)
- Factory CLAUDE.md (The Process as item #2, Term Violations Definition as item #5)
- TERM_VIOLATIONS_DEFINITION.md — new file defining what is/isn't a term violation (3 categories)
- Review prompt created for Episode 002
- Series Bible registry (unchanged)

### Previous Session Work (preserved)
- Episode 001 "Arriving from Between" — complete (~9,700 words)
- Episode 002 "The Buried Floor" — revised and ready for TTS (~9,200 words)
- Episode 003 "The God Particle" — complete (~9,600 words)
- Episode Factory — built and operational
- Anti-cloning system — tested across 3 episodes

## What's Next
- ~~CHECK Toma research~~ **RESOLVED** — Toma Oklobdžija is confirmed real. Documented on Tesla's baptism certificate (Nikola Tesla Museum, Belgrade) and Oklobdžija family genealogy site. Name is Layer 1 (searchable). Kept as-is in Episode 001.
- **All 3 episodes polished** — factual fixes + 7 term violation passes complete across all episodes
- **Choose topic for Episode 004** — Check Series Bible for anti-cloning constraints
- **Optional: scattered biological labels in Ep 003 first half** (lines 11-119, low density). Dense clusters already cleaned in Pass 2.

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **The Process** is now a permanent writing rule. Located at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/The Process- How to Rewrite Term Violations.txt`. READ IT before writing.
- **Law 3 was rewritten.** Bio metaphor is a mode of description, not a word count. Describe living processes without labels.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **The Attribution Rule** is in the Production Guide. Real facts = searchable. Fabricated facts = uncheckable. NEVER name real archives/orgs for fabricated material.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
- **Term Violations Definition** is at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/TERM_VIOLATIONS_DEFINITION.md`. Three categories: violations (apply The Process), not violations (leave alone), earned ambiguity (judgment call). Subject-matter nouns, prepositions, and emphasis words are NOT violations.
- **Term violation passes complete (7 of 7).** Results: "something" 92% earned, biological labels 43% cluster reduction, "recognition" 4 fixes, "as if" 7 tics fixed, "silence" clean, "same" clean, "version" 2 fixes, "old" 7 fixes (15% violation rate). The methodology is calibrated for future instances.
- **Peer review works.** Three-way (Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) + Opus 4.6 editorial pass.
- **Guiding Light is a designer, not a coder.** Explain in outcomes, not implementation.
