# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-16, continued session)

Polished Episode 001 through peer review, established new production rules, and wrote the Episode 002 brief.

### Episode 001 — Complete and shipped
- **Location:** `0. EPISODE FACTORY/EPISODES/001 - ARRIVING FROM BETWEEN/`
- Three-way external review (Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) applied 10 initial fixes
- Peer Opus review caught "managed narrative" redundancy — 6 thesis restatements reduced to 1
- Specific cuts: "Someone was managing this story" (line 73), "dismissal requires maintenance" (line 75), "Not destruction — management" (line 211), "Because someone has been managing" (line 219), two "curated/shaped" instances (lines 229, 245)
- Key learning: evidence should carry the thesis without the narrator labeling it. Trust the evidence.
- "Foxworth's agents" attribution fix for audio clarity in Kosanovic/Trump section
- Final state: ~9,700 words, zero thesis labels in back half, "managed" appears once as a noun

### File Naming Convention — Changed
- Old: `EPISODE_###_DRAFT.md`, `EPISODE_###_BRIEF.md`
- New: `###-EPISODE_TITLE-SCRIPT.md`, `###-EPISODE_TITLE-BRIEF.md`, `###-EPISODE_TITLE-REVIEW_PROMPT.md`
- Both Episode 001 and 003 renamed. Factory CLAUDE.md updated.

### Production Guide — Updated
- **The Attribution Rule** added to Evidence Layers section
- Layer 1: cite real sources with searchable breadcrumbs (books, archives, FOIA files)
- Layer 2: documentary texture only, NEVER attached to real archives/journals/researchers
- Real people: only in connection with things they actually said or published
- The asymmetry is the engine: real facts reward research, fabricated facts resist it

### Episode 002 "The Buried Floor" — Brief complete, ready to write
- **Topic:** Tartaria / Mud Flood / Erased Architecture
- **Location:** `0. EPISODE FACTORY/EPISODES/002 - THE BURIED FLOOR/`
- **Opening:** The Artifact (buried window, 1771 Britannica "Tartary" entry)
- **Structure:** The Descent (surface → scale → maps → Tesla → timeline question)
- **Closing:** The Invitation ("Walk to the oldest building in your city. Look down.")
- **Emotional endpoint:** Grief (irreplaceable loss — an entire world buried)
- **Tesla connection:** Technology descendant (Wardenclyffe as reconstruction, not invention)
- **Fabricated sources:** Exposition photographs predating groundbreaking, Singer Building sub-basement assessment, Chicago soil cores paper, Penn Station deposition
- **Layer 1 anchors:** 1771 Britannica, Chicago grade raise (Pullman), 1893 World's Fair, Penn Station/Singer demolitions, Wardenclyffe Tower
- Brief has been checked against Attribution Rule — no real institutions named for fabricated sources

### Previous Session Work (preserved)
- Episode 001 written (3 passes + expansion)
- Episode 003 "The God Particle" — complete
- Episode Factory — built and operational
- Anti-cloning system — built and tested across 2 episodes
- Project reorganization — complete

## What's Next
- **Write Episode 002** — brief is approved, start Pass 1. Read the Production Guide, Series Bible, Voice Reference, and brief. Write in 3-5 passes of 3-5K words each.
- Episode 001 is shipped — ready for TTS production
- After Episode 002: choose topic for Episode 004

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **The Attribution Rule** is now in the Production Guide. Real facts = searchable. Fabricated facts = uncheckable. Never mix.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
- **File naming:** `###-EPISODE_TITLE-TYPE.md` (SCRIPT, BRIEF, REVIEW_PROMPT)
- **Peer review works.** Send completed episodes to Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude for three-way review. Then apply fixes surgically — don't avoid substantive cuts.
- **Guiding Light is a designer, not a coder.** Explain in outcomes, not implementation.
