# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-16)

Wrote Episode 001 "Arriving from Between" — the series introduction episode. Tesla's death and birth bookended as a crime scene investigation.

### Episode 001 — Complete (reviewed and polished)
- **Topic:** Series introduction — Tesla's death (1943) and birth (1856) as bookended mystery
- **Location:** `0. EPISODE FACTORY/EPISODES/001 - ARRIVING FROM BETWEEN/`
- Written in 3 passes + expansion pass, ~126 paragraphs, ~9,900 words
- Structure: Crime scene investigation — starts at the death, works backward to the birth
- Opening: "The body wasn't even cold yet." (Fact that becomes horrifying)
- Closing: The Open Wound — "What... was Nikola Tesla?"
- Emotional endpoint: Paranoia (the official story is managed)
- Four fabricated sources: schoolteacher's diary, Father Toma's transfer, midwife's letter, OAP audit
- No Mandela Effects covered (series intro — single oblique gesture in closing)
- No mythology explained (no "infection," no "scar tissue," no "immune system")
- Series Bible updated with full Episode 001 registry entry
- **Three-way external review** (Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) — all positive, 10 fixes applied:
  - Breath paragraphs at both major transitions (sensory grounding)
  - Mid-section "you" moment after Father Toma
  - 2 speculative declarations softened to forensic inferences (Law 5)
  - "Paranoia you are feeling" replaced with show-don't-tell metaphor (Law 2)
  - TTS quote formatting (ellipsis pauses before quoted material)
  - Schoolteacher section trimmed ~70 words (density)
  - 2 redundant "managed narrative" restatements cut
  - 3 long sentences split for TTS breathing
  - Time marker added at Kosanovic/Trump transition (audio clarity)

### Previous Session Work (preserved)
- Episode 003 "The God Particle" — complete
- Episode Factory — built and operational
- Anti-cloning system — built and tested across 2 episodes
- Project reorganization — complete

## What's Next
- Episode 001 is ready for external review (Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) if desired
- Choose topic for Episode 004 and write it using the full system
- The system is proven across 2 episodes — all guardrails functioning

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing any brief.** Pick different choices from the menus. Check key images from recent episodes.
- **Guiding Light is a designer, not a coder.** Explain in outcomes, not implementation.
