# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-16)

Wrote Episode 002 "The Buried Floor" — first draft complete. Updated Series Bible and documentation.

### Episode 002 — "The Buried Floor" — First draft complete
- **Location:** `0. EPISODE FACTORY/EPISODES/002 - THE BURIED FLOOR/`
- **Word count:** ~10,000 words, 129 paragraphs
- **Topic:** Tartaria / Mud Flood / Erased Architecture
- Written in 3 passes with targeted expansions to hit 10K minimum
- **Opening:** The Artifact (a buried window below the sidewalk)
- **Structure:** The Descent (5 levels: surface → scale → maps → Tesla → timeline question)
- **Closing:** The Invitation ("Walk to the oldest building in your city. Look down.")
- **Emotional endpoint:** Grief
- **Tesla connection:** Technology descendant (Wardenclyffe as reconstruction of old architecture)
- **Fabricated sources:** All 4 placed and Attribution Rule compliant
- **Series Bible:** Registry entry added with all 7 anti-cloning dimensions + key images
- **Status:** Ready for peer review (three-way: Gemini, Perplexity, Claude)

### Previous Session Work (preserved)
- Episode 001 "Arriving from Between" — complete and shipped (~9,700 words)
- Episode 003 "The God Particle" — complete
- Episode Factory — built and operational
- Anti-cloning system — tested across 3 episodes
- The Attribution Rule — added to Production Guide
- File naming convention: `###-EPISODE_TITLE-TYPE.md`

## What's Next
- **Peer review Episode 002** — Send to Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude for three-way review. Apply fixes surgically.
- After review: Episode 002 is shipped — ready for TTS production
- **Choose topic for Episode 004** — Check Series Bible for anti-cloning constraints
- Continue building the episode library toward 100-200 standalone episodes

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **The Attribution Rule** is in the Production Guide. Real facts = searchable. Fabricated facts = uncheckable. Never mix.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
- **File naming:** `###-EPISODE_TITLE-TYPE.md` (SCRIPT, BRIEF, REVIEW_PROMPT)
- **Peer review works.** Send completed episodes to Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude for three-way review.
- **Guiding Light is a designer, not a coder.** Explain in outcomes, not implementation.
