# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-22, Session 2)

Episode 004 "The Tesla Brothers" expanded, edited, and verified. Now PRODUCTION-READY at ~11,585 words.

### Editor Reviews Applied
Three external editor reviews (Gemini 3.0, GPT 5.2, Claude 4.6) triaged and applied:
- **Factual fixes**: Wilbur Wright age corrected (forty-five → verified correct), cholera timeline clarified
- **Attribution fixes**: Tesla autobiography quotes verified exact, fabricated source boundaries confirmed clean
- **Craft fixes**: Organism/clock metaphors sharpened, "An organism" grammar fix, narrator identity leak ("this episode expands") removed
- **Audio pacing**: Short declarative sentences added at key transitions for TTS breathing room

### Expansion Pass
Script expanded from ~8,492 to ~11,585 words via 4 strategic insertions:
1. **Gospic sensory grounding** (~400 words) — garrison town atmosphere, Milutin's visible aging, parishioners learning not to mention Dane
2. **Cholera scene** (~700 words) — visceral disease progression, Milutin's desperate prayers through the wall, fever visions of Dane, deathbed bargain
3. **Colorado Springs & Wardenclyffe** (~500 words) — magnifying transmitter sensory scene, artificial lightning, Wardenclyffe tower and demolition
4. **OAP inventory discovery** (~350 words) — yellowed pages, typewriter degradation, pencil annotations, forensic mystery of "D. Tesla"

### Post-Expansion Cleanup
- Removed duplicate paragraphs (old OAP text that overlapped with expanded version)
- Removed orphaned "Czech Republic" Caption Key entry

### Pre-Delivery Verification (PASSED — all 13 categories)

- Quotes: Real quotes exact (Tesla "My Inventions"), fabricated quotes only in fabricated sources
- Attribution: 4 fabricated sources present and uncheckable
- Continuity: No contradictions
- Sensory grounding: All major locations anchored
- Term violations: None detected
- Paragraph count: ~382 (under 400 limit)
- Caption Key: Complete (orphan removed)

ALL THREE EPISODES (001-003) CLEARED FOR TTS. Production-ready. Final editorial reviews complete. Pre-Delivery Verification checklist codified. Term violation audit complete. Quote Attribution Rule audit complete.

## What's Next
- **Episode 004 is PRODUCTION-READY** — ~11,585 words, all verification passed
- **ALL FOUR EPISODES (001-004) now production-ready for TTS**
- **Choose topic for Episode 005** — Check Series Bible for anti-cloning constraints
- Episodes 001-003 remain production-ready

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **Use subagents for writing passes.** Main context is for coordination and verification only.
- **The Process** is a permanent writing rule. Located at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/The Process- How to Rewrite Term Violations.txt`.
- **Law 3 was rewritten.** Bio metaphor is a mode of description, not a word count.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **THE QUOTE RULE (CRITICAL/LEGAL):** Direct quotes attributed to real people must be exact, verified words. Fabricated quotes ONLY to fabricated sources.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
- **Term Violations Definition** at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/TERM_VIOLATIONS_DEFINITION.md`. Three categories.
