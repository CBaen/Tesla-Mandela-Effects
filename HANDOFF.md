# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-23)

Episode 005 "The Bell" received editorial reviews from GPT 5.2 and Opus 4.6. Two rounds of fixes applied: surgical corrections (12 fixes) and Law 3 biological metaphor pass. Standalone Rule violation discovered and fixed — episode references removed, rule codified in Production Guide and Factory CLAUDE.md.

### Episode 005 — Editorial Fixes Applied (~13,400 words)
- **12 surgical fixes:** Moment of inertia rewritten (factually wrong → accurate), 4 Attribution Rule violations de-checkabilized (FOIA/Trunk 47, Lunar Orbiter logs, Wardenclyffe county filing, JPL/MIT letter), Vasin credentials corrected, eclipse ratio fixed (~389 not 400), Kozyrev separated to Alphonsus, OAP/trunk anti-cloning reduced, overconfident claims softened, "millions" quantification softened, "This is..." cadence varied
- **Law 3 biological metaphor pass:** 8 insertions weaving organism/pathology language through science-heavy first half + 1 sensory anchor point ("you" returns between TLP and eclipse sections)
- **Standalone Rule violation fixed:** "In Episode Two/Three/Four..." references removed from lines 361-365, rewritten as world-phenomena

### New Rule Codified
- **STANDALONE RULE:** No episode may reference another by number, title, or concept. Added to Production Guide (Episode Structure section) and Factory CLAUDE.md (new section before "Your Job").

## What's Next
- **ALL FIVE EPISODES (001-005) now production-ready for TTS**
- **Choose topic for Episode 006** — Check Series Bible for anti-cloning constraints
- Episodes 001-004 remain production-ready

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need, including workflow expectations
- **ONE SESSION, ONE EPISODE.** Brief → writing passes (subagents) → verification (subagent) → commit. No handoffs.
- **The Process** is a permanent writing rule. Located at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/The Process- How to Rewrite Term Violations.txt`.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
- **STANDALONE RULE:** No episode may reference another. Every episode is entry point zero.
