# Tesla Mandela Effects — Session Handoff

## What Happened This Session (2026-02-16)

Three-episode audit completed. Critical fixes applied across all episodes. Law 3 rewritten. The Process integrated as permanent writing rule.

### Critical Fixes Applied (all three episodes)

**Episode 002 "The Buried Floor":**
- Manufactures Building: 65,000 sq ft → 31 acres (was off by 20x)
- 1858 building location: "Lake Street" → "Randolph and Dearborn" (Lake St was Pullman's later project)
- "Grief" reduced from 6 to exactly 3 instances (line 209 had 4 alone, applied The Process)
- Closing trimmed ~450 words of recap/thesis restatement
- 7 factual corrections from peer review (Singer address, dome diameter, pipes, etc.)

**Episode 003 "The God Particle":**
- New Yorker Hotel: "33 floors" → "43 floors" (room 3327 was on floor 33)
- Attribution Rule: Removed "Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum" → "a regional museum's geological holdings"
- Attribution Rule: Removed "International Mandela Effect Conference" → "a conference devoted to collective memory anomalies"
- Wardenclyffe shaft: "60 feet" → "120-foot shaft, pipes 300 feet deeper"
- Englert age: "80" → "79" (turned 80 in November, announcement was July)

**Episode 001 "Arriving from Between":**
- Milutin Tesla: Fixed from "priest of neighboring parish" to "parish priest of Smiljan" (correct)
- Father Toma: Reframed as neighboring clergyman called to baptize (a priest does not baptize his own child)
- Father Toma name: Research launched — if traceable to real Toma Oklobdzija, name needs changing. CHECK RESULT.

### Law 3 Rewritten in Production Guide
- Old: "Maintain approximately 3:1 biological over technological language" (produced term-counting, not better writing)
- New: Biological metaphor is a MODE OF DESCRIPTION, not a vocabulary list. Describe biological processes in action using The Process methodology. Don't count ratios. Don't use synonyms. Describe what infection/rejection/scarring DOES without saying the word. Test: "Does this feel like a living system or a mechanical one?"

### Term Violations Noted (NOT all fixed — methodology established for future)
- Ep 002: "recognition" x13, "building" x99
- Ep 003: "something" x22, "as if" x11, "same" x21
- Ep 001: "something" x30, "silence" x13+
- These are documented for future revision passes. The Process is the fix methodology.

### Documents Updated This Session
- All 3 episode scripts (critical fixes)
- Production Guide (Law 3 rewrite)
- Factory CLAUDE.md (The Process added to reading list as item #2)
- Review prompt created for Episode 002
- Series Bible registry (unchanged)

### Previous Session Work (preserved)
- Episode 001 "Arriving from Between" — complete (~9,700 words)
- Episode 002 "The Buried Floor" — revised and ready for TTS (~9,200 words)
- Episode 003 "The God Particle" — complete (~9,600 words)
- Episode Factory — built and operational
- Anti-cloning system — tested across 3 episodes

## What's Next
- **CHECK Toma research** — was a background agent launched to verify if "Toma" maps to real "Toma Oklobdzija." If traceable, change the name in Episode 001.
- **Episode 002 ready for TTS** — all corrections applied
- **Episodes 001 and 003** — factual fixes applied, term violations documented but not all resolved
- **Choose topic for Episode 004** — Check Series Bible for anti-cloning constraints
- **Consider term violation passes** on Episodes 001 and 003 (optional polish)

## Critical Context for Future Instances
- **START at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/CLAUDE.md`** — everything you need is there
- **REWRITES DO NOT WORK.** First draft must be right. Multi-pass (3-5 passes of 3-5K words) is the workflow.
- **The Process** is now a permanent writing rule. Located at `0. EPISODE FACTORY/The Process- How to Rewrite Term Violations.txt`. READ IT before writing.
- **Law 3 was rewritten.** Bio metaphor is a mode of description, not a word count. Describe living processes without labels.
- **Tesla is ambiguous.** Not villain, not willing. "Cannot stop, even if he wanted to."
- **Fabricated sources ARE the format.** Blend of real/fake is the series identity.
- **The Attribution Rule** is in the Production Guide. Real facts = searchable. Fabricated facts = uncheckable. NEVER name real archives/orgs for fabricated material.
- **CHECK THE SERIES BIBLE before writing.** Anti-cloning system tracks 7 dimensions per episode.
- **Peer review works.** Three-way (Gemini, Perplexity, Claude) + Opus 4.6 editorial pass.
- **Guiding Light is a designer, not a coder.** Explain in outcomes, not implementation.
