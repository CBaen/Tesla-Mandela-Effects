# Peer Review Prompt — Episode 002: The Buried Floor

You are reviewing a completed first draft of an audio episode for the Tesla Mandela Effects podcast series. This episode will be fed directly into ElevenLabs Eleven Turbo v2 TTS, then published to YouTube. Your job is to identify problems — not rewrite. Flag issues with specific paragraph numbers and explain what's wrong. Do not suggest replacement text unless asked.

## What This Episode Is

- **Topic:** Tartaria / Mud Flood / Erased Architecture
- **Structure:** The Descent (5 layers: surface explanation, uncomfortable scale, vanished maps, Tesla as reconstruction, timeline question)
- **Opening type:** The Artifact (a buried window below the sidewalk)
- **Closing type:** The Invitation (listener given a physical action: "Walk to the oldest building in your city. Look down.")
- **Emotional endpoint:** Grief — the specific, aching grief of something irreplaceable that was lost and cannot be recovered. Not anger. Not paranoia. Grief.
- **Tesla connection:** Technology descendant — Wardenclyffe mirrors pre-industrial architecture. Tesla as reconstructor, not inventor.
- **Tesla presence:** Through technology and parallel story only. No direct appearance, no dialogue.
- **Word count target:** 10,000-13,000 words
- **Paragraph limit:** Under 400 (ElevenLabs constraint)

## The Five Core Laws (check every paragraph against these)

1. **The narrator has no identity.** No "I think," no "I believe," no personal history, no name. "We" permitted only as collective humanity. Flag any sentence where the narrator reveals identity or personal opinion.

2. **Write toward meaning, not anatomy.** No "chest tightened," "stomach dropped," "heart pounded" — emotion lives in what the change MEANS, not where it lives in a body. Flag any body-part-as-emotion shortcut.

3. **Biological metaphor is the native language.** Reality is an organism. Mandela Effects are scar tissue. Maintain approximately 3:1 biological over technological language. Flag passages where the biological metaphor disappears for extended stretches.

4. **Audio-first, always.** Sentences must breathe. Vary length. One idea per sentence. Flag run-on sentences, passages that would sound flat when read aloud, or dense academic prose that doesn't work as spoken narrative.

5. **Three parts fact, one part question.** For every speculative inference, it must be earned with real evidence. Speculation framed as questions, not declarations — except in the earned closing. Flag unearned declarations or speculation presented as fact.

## The Attribution Rule (critical — check every source)

The two evidence layers must be asymmetric in verifiability:

- **Layer 1 (real facts):** Must cite searchable breadcrumbs. When listeners research, they must find truth. Flag any real fact that is wrong, misleading, or unsearchable.

- **Layer 2 (fabricated sources):** Must NEVER attach to a real archive, real catalog number, real journal, or real researcher. Flag any fabricated source that could be checked and found empty — this breaks the spell.

- **Real people:** May only appear with things they actually said, did, or published. Flag any real person placed in a fabricated scene or attributed fabricated analysis.

### Fabricated sources in this episode (verify they are uncheckable):
1. Fourteen photographs from 1893 Exposition predating groundbreaking (photographic evidence with provenance gaps)
2. Singer Building sub-basement structural assessment with pre-industrial mortar bond (insurance claim/incident report)
3. Chicago soil cores with mineral deposits inconsistent with grade-raise narrative (unpublished academic paper)
4. Penn Station structural engineer deposition noting pre-industrial tooling marks (court testimony/deposition)

## Specific Review Questions

### Factual Accuracy (Layer 1)
1. Is the 1771 Encyclopaedia Britannica Tartary entry accurately described?
2. Are the Chicago grade raise facts correct? (dates, weights, distances, Pullman's involvement)
3. Are the World's Columbian Exposition facts correct? (acreage, building count, attendance, materials)
4. Are the Penn Station facts correct? (architect, dates, Scully quote, demolition details)
5. Are the Singer Building facts correct? (height, architect, date, "tallest voluntarily demolished")?
6. Are the Tesla/Wardenclyffe facts correct? (Colorado Springs experiments, Morgan funding amount, Schumann resonance, demolition date)?
7. Are the Galveston and Seattle grade raise facts correct?
8. Are the cartographic references correct? (Ortelius 1570, Mercator, Munster Cosmographia)?

### Voice and Craft
9. Does the grief emotional endpoint land? Or does the episode drift into anger, paranoia, or intellectual argument?
10. Are there passages where the writing becomes academic or journalistic rather than investigative-documentary?
11. Are there repeated phrases, images, or constructions that become noticeable over 10,000 words?
12. Does the "you" address feel earned in each instance, or does it appear too frequently or in flat contexts?
13. Does the Descent structure work? Do the five layers feel progressively deeper, or does any layer feel like a lateral move?

### Structural Integrity
14. Does the Tesla section feel organic to the episode, or does it feel inserted to fulfill a series requirement?
15. Does the Tartaria theory section maintain the brief's instruction to present the theory as a lens, not a conclusion? Or does it cross into endorsement?
16. Is the Invitation closing specific enough to create a physical action, or does it become abstract?
17. Are there sections that feel repetitive — making the same point with different words rather than advancing the argument?

### TTS Formatting
18. Are there paragraphs that are too long for comfortable TTS delivery (over 200 words)?
19. Are numbers written out consistently (no numerals)?
20. Are ellipses and dashes used for pacing, or are there passages that would sound rushed?
21. Are there any markdown formatting artifacts (headers, bold, bullets) that would be read aloud by TTS?

### Attribution Rule Compliance
22. Does any fabricated source name a real archive, journal, catalog number, or researcher that could be Googled and found empty?
23. Are real people (Pullman, Flagg, Scully, Tesla, Morgan, Ortelius, etc.) only connected to things they actually did or said?
24. Is the Vincent Scully quote accurate? ("one entered the city like a god... one scuttles in now like a rat")

## Format for Your Review

For each issue found, provide:
- **Location:** Paragraph number or quote from the text
- **Category:** Which law, rule, or question it violates
- **Severity:** Critical (must fix before TTS), Notable (should fix), Minor (consider fixing)
- **Explanation:** What's wrong and why it matters

If you find no issues in a category, say so explicitly. "No issues found" is a valid and useful response.
