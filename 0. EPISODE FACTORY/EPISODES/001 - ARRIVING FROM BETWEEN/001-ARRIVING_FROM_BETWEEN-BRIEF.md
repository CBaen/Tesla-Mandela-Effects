# Episode 001 — Arriving from Between

## Purpose
This is the series introduction. It establishes the voice, the tone, and the central mystery — but does NOT explain the mythology. The listener should leave this episode knowing WHAT happened (a man died, his papers were seized, something was wrong about his birth) but not WHY. The standalone episodes that follow will each contribute one piece of the puzzle. This episode opens the file. It does not close it.

## The Wound
Nikola Tesla himself. His death and his birth — bookended, with the investigation running backward from the body to the incision. The wound is the question: what was Nikola Tesla, and why did the government arrive at his hotel room before the family?

## Opening Hook Concept
"The body wasn't even cold yet." — Fact that becomes horrifying. Seven words. You don't know whose body. You don't know why it matters. And then the FBI arrives before the family is notified, and the horror is not the death — it's the speed of the response. Someone was waiting. Someone was watching the hotel room for the old man's heart to stop.

## Layer 1 — Verifiable Facts (anchors)

1. **Tesla's death: January 7, 1943.** Room 3327, New Yorker Hotel, 34th and 8th, Manhattan. Age 86. Cause of death: coronary thrombosis. Found by a maid after a "do not disturb" sign had been on the door for two days. He had been living at the hotel for a decade, alone, feeding pigeons in Bryant Park.

2. **The FBI seizure.** The Office of Alien Property — a wartime agency with no jurisdiction over American citizens — seized approximately 80 trunks of papers, notebooks, and personal effects within days of the death. Agent in charge: P.E. Foxworth, assistant director of the New York FBI office. Tesla had been a naturalized citizen since 1891. The legal basis for the seizure has never been explained.

3. **Sava Kosanovic.** Tesla's nephew, a Yugoslav diplomat. Arrived at the hotel the next morning. Told agents something was missing — items he had seen weeks earlier were not in the inventory. The papers were eventually reviewed by John G. Trump (MIT) and returned to Yugoslavia. But researchers have documented gaps between Tesla's own correspondence references and what arrived in Belgrade.

4. **Tesla's birth: July 10, 1856.** Smiljan, in the Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). The famous story: born during a violent thunderstorm, the midwife said "he will be a child of darkness," mother Djuka replied "no, he will be a child of light." Father: Milutin Tesla, Serbian Orthodox priest. The storm story appears in every biography.

5. **The meteorological record.** The Central Meteorological Institute in Vienna maintained hourly weather logs for the Austrian Empire. These logs are preserved. They can be checked. (Note to writer: research whether the storm story is actually contradicted by the weather record, or whether the record is ambiguous/missing for that specific location. The old Episode 001 claimed "there was no storm" but this needs verification. If the record genuinely contradicts the storm legend, use it as Layer 1. If it's ambiguous, the contradiction itself becomes the story.)

## Tesla's Connection
**Direct appearance.** Tesla is not referenced through his experiments or his legacy. He IS the episode. His death opens it. His birth closes it. But he is present only through the evidence left behind — the hotel room, the trunks, the seized papers, the baptismal record. He is the absence at the center of the investigation.

## Structural Shape
**Crime scene investigation.** Start at the "body" (Tesla's death, the hotel room, the seizure). Then work backward — who was this man? Why the urgency? Each evidence movement peels back another layer, moving from the known (the death) toward the unknown (the birth). The listener travels backward through time, not forward. The final movement is the birth itself — the earliest evidence, the deepest mystery.

## Emotional Thesis
By the close, the listener should feel **paranoia** — the unsettling conviction that something about the official story is managed. Too many people went silent. Too many documents disappeared. Too many agencies moved too fast. The death was not the beginning of the cover-up. The death was the end of the surveillance. And the birth — the event that started all of it — is surrounded by witnesses who stopped talking, a priest who took a vow of silence, and a village that went quiet for forty days. Someone has been managing this story for a very long time.

## Closing Type
**The Open Wound.** The investigation does not conclude. It opens. The final lines should feel like the first page of a case file being placed on a desk. The listener has seen the evidence. They have questions. And the investigation says: so do we. This is not the end. This is the incision.

Do NOT explain the mythology. Do not say "Tesla was an infection." Do not say "Mandela Effects are scar tissue." Do not say "the universe has an immune system." Those are conclusions the series will earn over dozens of episodes. This episode earns only one thing: the certainty that something is wrong.

## Fabricated Sources (Layer 2)

1. **Personal diary — the schoolteacher of Smiljan.** A diary kept by the village schoolteacher, surviving in fragments. Entries from the summer of 1856 describing the village in the weeks after Tesla's birth — animals behaving strangely, milk spoiling, birds absent from the chimneys. The diary does not mention Tesla by name. It describes a season that was wrong. The schoolteacher writes about the silence as if it were a weather event.

2. **Institutional correspondence — Father Toma's transfer request.** The parish priest who performed Tesla's baptism requested transfer to a mountain monastery three weeks after the birth. Official records show he claimed a palsy of the hand. His transfer documents show the hand was steady. He took a vow of contemplative silence and never spoke again for thirty-five years. In the margin of his transfer request, a phrase in Latin: "Quod transit debet cito nominari" — "What comes through must be named quickly."

3. **Oral history — the midwife's letter.** A letter from the midwife (named only as Marta in family accounts) to her sister in Zagreb, three weeks after the birth, found inside a family Bible in 1934. Describes the walk to the Tesla house, the static electricity, the vibrating water in the basin, the exploding oil lamp, a moment of "geometric absence" in the darkness. Marta refused to hold the infant. She buried the cord-cutting knife in the yard, claiming the handle was hot. She called what she heard "the grinding."

4. **Declassified government report (partially redacted) — OAP inventory discrepancy.** A partially redacted Office of Alien Property internal audit from 1945, two years after the seizure, noting a discrepancy between the number of trunks logged at the New Yorker Hotel (80) and the number transferred to the Manhattan Storage and Warehouse Company. The audit recommends reconciliation. A handwritten note in the margin: "Reconciled. No further action." The number that was reconciled is redacted.

## What This Episode Must NOT Do
- Do not cover Colorado Springs, Wardenclyffe, Tunguska, the Philadelphia Experiment, or CERN. Those are future standalone episodes.
- Do not explain the series mythology (infection, immune system, scar tissue). That framework is EARNED across the series, not handed out in Episode 1.
- Do not use Mandela Effects as primary content. A single gesture toward them in the closing is permitted — "the evidence of what came through is still spreading" — but no specific effects. Those are for standalone episodes.
- Do not resolve the mystery of Tesla's birth. Leave it open. The priest went silent. The midwife wouldn't talk about it. The village went quiet. The file remains open.
