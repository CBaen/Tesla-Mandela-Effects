# Tesla Mandela Effects — Series Bible
## Anti-Cloning Registry

This file prevents episode cloning. Before writing any episode brief, the writer MUST read this file and ensure the new episode does not duplicate:
- The same closing type as the previous 3 episodes
- The same opening type as the previous 2 episodes
- The same structural shape as the previous 2 episodes
- The same Tesla connection type as the previous 2 episodes
- Any Mandela Effect that was a PRIMARY feature in the last 5 episodes
- The same fabricated source format used in the previous episode
- The same emotional endpoint as any episode in the last 5
- Any key image from the previous 3 episodes

Mandela Effects and Tesla experiments CAN recur as passing references or brief mentions — they just cannot be the central anchor again within the window above.

## Opening Types (never use the same type twice in a row)

1. **Direct address question** — "Have you ever heard...?" "Where were you when...?" Puts the listener on the spot immediately.
2. **Declarative impossibility** — "There is a photograph that should not exist." A fact that shouldn't be true, stated as fact.
3. **Sensory hook** — "The sound started at three forty-seven AM." Drop the listener into a physical sensation before explaining anything.
4. **Witness cold open** — "The first thing she noticed was the smell." Start mid-scene with an unnamed witness, context arrives later.
5. **Fact that becomes horrifying** — "On March fourteenth, nineteen ninety-one, every Bible on Earth was different." State something verifiable that, in context, is terrifying.
6. **The negation** — "This is not about what happened. This is about what didn't." Deny the obvious frame, force the listener to rebuild their expectation.
7. **The artifact** — Start with a physical object (a letter, a photograph, a device) and let the object tell the story.

## Structural Shapes (vary — never use the same shape twice in a row)

1. **Chronological spiral** — Move through time, each pass adds layers of evidence and reinterpretation.
2. **Crime scene investigation** — Start at the anomaly (the "body"), work backward through evidence to find the cause.
3. **Dual timeline** — Intercut two time periods that appear unrelated, revealed to be the same event from different angles.
4. **Single witness** — One person's experience carries the entire episode. Intimate, claustrophobic, deeply personal.
5. **The descent** — Start on the surface (the accepted version), go progressively deeper into stranger territory. Each level peels back another layer.
6. **The collection** — Multiple apparently unrelated anomalies, each given its own mini-investigation, revealed in the closing to be connected.
7. **The trial** — Prosecution vs defense. Present the case, present the counter-case, let the evidence deliver a verdict the listener didn't expect.
8. **The letter** — Framed as a document being read or received. A report, a diary, a testimony that structures the entire narrative.

## Closing Types (rotate — never use the same type twice in a row)

1. **The Mirror** — Final question turns the listener into the subject ("are you the scar?")
2. **The Open Wound** — Investigation ends mid-sentence, unresolved, as if the file is still open
3. **The Callback** — Final line echoes the opening hook, transformed by everything learned
4. **The Witness** — Closing is a fabricated testimony that reframes the entire episode
5. **The Inversion** — The "safe" explanation turns out to be more terrifying than the conspiracy
6. **The Silence** — The investigation reaches a point where there is nothing left to say, and says so
7. **The Invitation** — Listener is given a specific action (look something up, check something physical)

## Emotional Endpoints (vary — never use the same endpoint in consecutive episodes)

1. **Existential dread** — "Are you the original, or the copy?" The ground beneath the listener is not solid.
2. **Wonder / awe** — The universe is stranger and more beautiful than the official version allows. The anomaly is not a threat — it is a glimpse.
3. **Grief** — Something irreplaceable was lost. A person, a timeline, a version of reality that was better than this one. And it cannot be recovered.
4. **Paranoia** — Someone is watching. Someone is managing. The anomaly is not an accident — it is maintenance.
5. **Quiet acceptance** — The change has already happened. It happened years ago. And the listener has been living in the altered version without knowing. There is nothing to do. There is only the knowing.
6. **Defiance** — The listener is asked to resist. To remember. To refuse the update. Your memory is the last copy of the original — do not let it be overwritten.
7. **Loneliness** — The listener's unique memory isolates them. They are carrying something no one else can verify. The anomaly makes them a stranger in their own world.
8. **Vertigo** — Nothing is solid. Not the ground, not the memories, not the self. The episode ends in freefall.

## Tesla Connection Types (vary across episodes)

1. **Direct appearance** — Tesla is a character in the episode, with scenes and dialogue
2. **Experiment consequence** — Tesla's specific experiment caused or enabled the anomaly
3. **Technology descendant** — Modern technology unknowingly continues Tesla's work
4. **Philosophical parallel** — Tesla's IDEAS (not experiments) illuminate the anomaly
5. **Absence** — Tesla's MISSING work (seized papers, lost notebooks) is the connection
6. **Opposition** — Someone or something worked to UNDO what Tesla started

## Fabricated Source Formats (never repeat the same format in consecutive episodes)

- Classified internal memo
- Geological/environmental survey
- Monitoring station log with handwritten annotation
- Anonymous letter from insider/whistleblower
- Declassified government report (partially redacted)
- Personal diary or journal entry
- Oral history / recorded interview transcript
- Institutional correspondence (university, military, corporate)
- Unpublished academic paper
- Photographic evidence with provenance gaps
- Court testimony or deposition
- Insurance claim or incident report

## Episode Registry

### 003 — THE GOD PARTICLE
- **Wound:** CERN Large Hadron Collider and Mandela Effects
- **Opening type:** Direct address question ("Have you ever heard a sound that wasn't there?")
- **Structural shape:** Chronological spiral (1899 → present, each pass adds a new evidence layer)
- **Closing type:** The Mirror — listener asked if they are the scar, the residue of an overwritten version
- **Emotional endpoint:** Existential dread — "are you the original or the copy?"
- **Tesla connection type:** Experiment consequence (Colorado Springs frequency → CERN unknowingly continues the resonance work)
- **Tesla presence:** Direct appearance (Colorado Springs 1899, Wardenclyffe 1901-1917, death 1943)
- **Key locations:** Colorado Springs, Shoreham/Long Island, CERN/Meyrin, New Yorker Hotel Manhattan
- **Key experiments:** Colorado Springs magnifying transmitter, Wardenclyffe Tower, LHC particle collisions
- **Mandela Effects (primary):** Berenstain Bears, Fruit of the Loom cornucopia, Monopoly Man monocle, "Luke I am your father"
- **Fabricated sources:** Classified internal memo (Frequency Discrepancy Report), geological survey (Colorado Springs soil), monitoring station log (Schumann Deviation Log, Tromsø), anonymous insider letter (calibration engineer)
- **Key images (DO NOT REUSE in next 3 episodes):**
  - "tourniquet around a limb that was losing blood"
