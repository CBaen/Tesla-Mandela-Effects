# Tesla Mandela Effects — Series Bible
## Anti-Cloning Registry

This file prevents episode cloning. Before writing any episode brief, the writer MUST read this file and ensure the new episode does not duplicate:
- The same closing type as the previous 3 episodes
- The same opening type as the previous 2 episodes
- The same structural shape as the previous 2 episodes
- The same Tesla connection type as the previous 2 episodes
- Any Mandela Effect that was a PRIMARY feature in the last 5 episodes
- The same fabricated source format used in the previous episode
- The same emotional endpoint as any episode in the last 5
- Any key image from the previous 3 episodes

Mandela Effects and Tesla experiments CAN recur as passing references or brief mentions — they just cannot be the central anchor again within the window above.

## Opening Types (never use the same type twice in a row)

1. **Direct address question** — "Have you ever heard...?" "Where were you when...?" Puts the listener on the spot immediately.
2. **Declarative impossibility** — "There is a photograph that should not exist." A fact that shouldn't be true, stated as fact.
3. **Sensory hook** — "The sound started at three forty-seven AM." Drop the listener into a physical sensation before explaining anything.
4. **Witness cold open** — "The first thing she noticed was the smell." Start mid-scene with an unnamed witness, context arrives later.
5. **Fact that becomes horrifying** — "On March fourteenth, nineteen ninety-one, every Bible on Earth was different." State something verifiable that, in context, is terrifying.
6. **The negation** — "This is not about what happened. This is about what didn't." Deny the obvious frame, force the listener to rebuild their expectation.
7. **The artifact** — Start with a physical object (a letter, a photograph, a device) and let the object tell the story.

## Structural Shapes (vary — never use the same shape twice in a row)

1. **Chronological spiral** — Move through time, each pass adds layers of evidence and reinterpretation.
2. **Crime scene investigation** — Start at the anomaly (the "body"), work backward through evidence to find the cause.
3. **Dual timeline** — Intercut two time periods that appear unrelated, revealed to be the same event from different angles.
4. **Single witness** — One person's experience carries the entire episode. Intimate, claustrophobic, deeply personal.
5. **The descent** — Start on the surface (the accepted version), go progressively deeper into stranger territory. Each level peels back another layer.
6. **The collection** — Multiple apparently unrelated anomalies, each given its own mini-investigation, revealed in the closing to be connected.
7. **The trial** — Prosecution vs defense. Present the case, present the counter-case, let the evidence deliver a verdict the listener didn't expect.
8. **The letter** — Framed as a document being read or received. A report, a diary, a testimony that structures the entire narrative.

## Closing Types (rotate — never use the same type twice in a row)

1. **The Mirror** — Final question turns the listener into the subject ("are you the scar?")
2. **The Open Wound** — Investigation ends mid-sentence, unresolved, as if the file is still open
3. **The Callback** — Final line echoes the opening hook, transformed by everything learned
4. **The Witness** — Closing is a fabricated testimony that reframes the entire episode
5. **The Inversion** — The "safe" explanation turns out to be more terrifying than the conspiracy
6. **The Silence** — The investigation reaches a point where there is nothing left to say, and says so
7. **The Invitation** — Listener is given a specific action (look something up, check something physical)

## Emotional Endpoints (vary — never use the same endpoint in consecutive episodes)

1. **Existential dread** — "Are you the original, or the copy?" The ground beneath the listener is not solid.
2. **Wonder / awe** — The universe is stranger and more beautiful than the official version allows. The anomaly is not a threat — it is a glimpse.
3. **Grief** — Something irreplaceable was lost. A person, a timeline, a version of reality that was better than this one. And it cannot be recovered.
4. **Paranoia** — Someone is watching. Someone is managing. The anomaly is not an accident — it is maintenance.
5. **Quiet acceptance** — The change has already happened. It happened years ago. And the listener has been living in the altered version without knowing. There is nothing to do. There is only the knowing.
6. **Defiance** — The listener is asked to resist. To remember. To refuse the update. Your memory is the last copy of the original — do not let it be overwritten.
7. **Loneliness** — The listener's unique memory isolates them. They are carrying something no one else can verify. The anomaly makes them a stranger in their own world.
8. **Vertigo** — Nothing is solid. Not the ground, not the memories, not the self. The episode ends in freefall.

## Tesla Connection Types (vary across episodes)

1. **Direct appearance** — Tesla is a character in the episode, with scenes and dialogue
2. **Experiment consequence** — Tesla's specific experiment caused or enabled the anomaly
3. **Technology descendant** — Modern technology unknowingly continues Tesla's work
4. **Philosophical parallel** — Tesla's IDEAS (not experiments) illuminate the anomaly
5. **Absence** — Tesla's MISSING work (seized papers, lost notebooks) is the connection
6. **Opposition** — Someone or something worked to UNDO what Tesla started

## Fabricated Source Formats (never repeat the same format in consecutive episodes)

- Classified internal memo
- Geological/environmental survey
- Monitoring station log with handwritten annotation
- Anonymous letter from insider/whistleblower
- Declassified government report (partially redacted)
- Personal diary or journal entry
- Oral history / recorded interview transcript
- Institutional correspondence (university, military, corporate)
- Unpublished academic paper
- Photographic evidence with provenance gaps
- Court testimony or deposition
- Insurance claim or incident report

- **Opening type:** Direct address question ("Have you ever heard a sound that wasn't there?")
- **Structural shape:** Chronological spiral (1899 → present, each pass adds a new evidence layer)
- **Closing type:** The Mirror — listener asked if they are the scar, the residue of an overwritten version
- **Emotional endpoint:** Existential dread — "are you the original or the copy?"
- **Tesla connection type:** Experiment consequence (Colorado Springs frequency → CERN unknowingly continues the resonance work)

- **Names spent:** Nikola Tesla, Peter Higgs, Francois Englert, Robert Brout, Fabiola Gianotti, Joe Incandela, Leon Lederman, Winfried Otto Schumann, Guglielmo Marconi, J.P. Morgan, Fiona Broome, Elizabeth Loftus, John G. Trump, Felix Bloch, James Earl Jones, Stan and Jan Berenstain

### 002 — THE BURIED FLOOR
- **Wound:** Tartaria / Mud Flood / Erased Architecture — buried first floors, demolished buildings, vanished maps, and the unnamed grief millions carry for a world they were never told existed
- **Opening type:** The Artifact (a buried window below the sidewalk — physical object the listener can find in their own city)
- **Structural shape:** The Descent (five layers: surface explanation → uncomfortable scale → vanished maps → Tesla as reconstruction → timeline question)
- **Closing type:** The Invitation — listener given a physical action ("Walk to the oldest building in your city. Look down.")
- **Emotional endpoint:** Grief — the specific, aching grief of something irreplaceable that was lost and cannot be recovered
- **Tesla connection type:** Technology descendant (Wardenclyffe's architecture mirrors pre-industrial buildings — copper dome, metal spire, deep foundation — Tesla as reconstructor, not inventor)
- **Tesla presence:** Present through technology and parallel story only — no direct appearance, no dialogue
- **Key locations:** Chicago (grade raise, World's Columbian Exposition), Manhattan (Penn Station, Singer Building), Galveston, Seattle, Shoreham/Long Island (Wardenclyffe), Colorado Springs
- **Mandela Effects (primary):** Architectural/spatial — collective, uncoordinated grief as the anomaly itself. Millions independently arriving at the same recognition (Tartaria theory) across languages and cultures without coordination. The simultaneity IS the anomaly.
- **Fabricated sources:** Exposition photographs predating groundbreaking (photographic evidence with provenance gaps), Singer Building sub-basement assessment with pre-industrial mortar bond (insurance claim/incident report), Chicago soil cores with mineral deposits inconsistent with grade-raise narrative (unpublished academic paper), Penn Station structural engineer deposition noting pre-industrial tooling marks (court testimony/deposition)
- **Key images (DO NOT REUSE in next 3 episodes):**
  - "a window that faces dirt" — the buried first-floor perspective
  - "the floor that no one talks about" — the forgotten ground floor
  - "a country that vanished from all cartography" — Tartary's erasure from maps
  - "thirty-five thousand tons raised in five days" — the scale of the Chicago grade raise
  - "completed ornamentation on buildings not yet constructed" — the provenance-gapped photographs
  - "predating the superstructure by an indeterminate period" — the Singer Building sub-basement
  - "the beauty was the function" — ornament as engineering, not decoration
  - "an unconformity" — the fill as a boundary layer between versions of the world
  - "the recognition, once it arrives, does not leave" — seeing the buried floors everywhere
  - "a room that has been holding its breath" — the sealed space behind the buried window
- **Unique elements:** 1771 Encyclopaedia Britannica Tartary entry, Ortelius/Mercator/Munster map tradition, geological unconformity metaphor, Wardenclyffe architecture as mirror of pre-industrial buildings, Morgan's withdrawal as market defending metered scarcity, Landmarks Commission silence on Singer Building, Tartaria theory simultaneity as Mandela Effect
- **Names spent:** Nikola Tesla, George Pullman, Abraham Ortelius, Gerard Mercator, Sebastian Munster, Andrew Bell, Colin Macfarquhar, Ernest Flagg, Vincent Scully, J.P. Morgan, Guglielmo Marconi, Winfried Otto Schumann

### 004 — THE TESLA BROTHERS
- **Wound:** Dane Tesla — the brother the universe removed. Tesla's lifelong loneliness reframed as amputation, not personality
- **Opening type:** The negation ("This is not about what Nikola Tesla built. This is about who was supposed to help him build it.")
- **Structural shape:** Single witness (Tesla's entire life is testimony to his brother's erasure — five movements through one absence)
- **Closing type:** The Witness — Zagreb oral history reframes the episode, then the investigation turns outward to the listener
- **Emotional endpoint:** Loneliness — not romantic or sentimental, but forensic. The shape of the wound tells you what made it
- **Tesla connection type:** Direct appearance (Tesla is the episode — his life examined through negative space, through what is missing)
- **Tesla presence:** Central subject — every major life beat reexamined as evidence of amputation rather than personality
- **Key locations:** Smiljan village (Croatia), Gospic (Church of Great Martyr George), Colorado Springs, Wardenclyffe/Long Island, New Yorker Hotel Room 3327 (Manhattan), Zagreb (regional folklore study), Gracac (church renovation)
- **Mandela Effects (primary):** Person erasure (Dane Tesla) — new category. Expands Mandela Effect from objects to people. The accepted narrative (Tesla as solitary genius) is the overwritten version.
- **Fabricated sources:** Psychoanalyst's session notes, Manhattan 1937 — "N.T." patient, empty chair, reaching to the left (personal diary/journal entry); OAP inventory discrepancy, Item 1247 — "D. Tesla — correspondence, three items" crossed out (declassified government report); Djuka Tesla letter to cousin in Gracac, 1865 — Dane's machine drawings found in his belongings (institutional correspondence/family document); Zagreb Folklore Archive oral history, 1974 — M.K. insists "the Tesla boys" attended church together (oral history/recorded interview transcript)
- **Key images (DO NOT REUSE in next 3 episodes):**
  - "the shape of amputation" — loneliness as surgical removal, not personality
  - "the empty chair" — psychoanalyst's notes, Tesla building his entire life around an absence
  - "reaching to his left" — recurring dream of the partner always on the left side
  - "machines that look like the inside of a clock" — Djuka's letter about Dane's drawings
  - "the quiet one drew machines while the loud one sang" — Zagreb testimony of complementary brothers
  - "a weapon forged from the violence of loss" — visualization method as trauma-weapon
  - "the wound made the instrument" — trauma producing the apparatus of genius
  - "a horse in summer, in a garden" — the accident scene in Smiljan
  - "the domino chain" — cascade from Dane's death to alternating current
  - "the architecture of survival" — building around absence as structural necessity
- **Unique elements:** Person-erasure as Mandela Effect category, two competing accounts of horse accident (pea-shooter vs unprovoked), visualization method reframed as grief symptom not neurological gift, brother-pair framework (Wright Brothers, Montgolfier Brothers), OAP "D. Tesla" inventory gap, wire-to-tape transfer destroying M.K.'s voice, Djuka's undated machine drawings
- **Names spent:** Nikola Tesla, Dane Tesla, Milutin Tesla, Djuka Tesla (née Mandic), Angelina Tesla, Milka Tesla, Marica Tesla, Wilbur Wright, Orville Wright, Joseph-Michel Montgolfier, Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier, Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, J.P. Morgan
