## What Is a Term Violation?

<term_violation_definition>
A term violation is any word that substitutes for an experience the writer did not build.

It is not "any word appearing frequently." It is not a vocabulary problem. It is a craft problem — the writer reached for a label instead of creating the feeling, the sensation, or the quality of attention that the listener needs to experience.

**The test:** Could this word be replaced with something more specific that would create a richer experience for the listener? If yes, it's a violation. If the word is doing its job — if it names a thing, anchors a location, or provides intentional ambiguity — it stays.

The goal is never zero instances of any word. The goal is zero instances of laziness wearing that word's clothes.

## Three Categories

<violation_categories>

### Violations — Apply The Process

These are words substituting for experiences. When you find one, apply The Process: name the concept, read the territory, write toward meaning.

- **Body-part emotion:** "His chest tightened," "her stomach dropped," "his throat closed." The writer defaulted to anatomy instead of describing what the emotional event IS and what it MEANS in this specific moment.

- **Label words:** "Grief," "recognition," "dread," "horror" used as thesis statements instead of being built through images. The word announces the feeling instead of creating it. (Three uses of "grief" across an episode may be fine. Eleven means you're labeling instead of building.)

- **"Felt" / "watched" / "noticed":** These are narration shortcuts. "He felt something cold" — what is the sensation itself? "She watched the door" — what is the quality of her attention? The Process asks you to describe the experience without the framing verb.

- **Vague placeholders:** "Something dark," "something wrong," "something else." When "something" is a placeholder for a specific thing the writer could have identified but didn't, it's a violation.

- **"As if" as a crutch:** The construction "as if" allows the writer to gesture at a comparison without committing to a direct description. Occasional use is fine — it's a natural narrative tool. When it appears ten or more times in an episode, half of those instances are tics, not choices. Audit each one. Convert the lazy half to direct descriptions.

- **Biological labels instead of biological description (Law 3):** "The infection spread" is a label. "It arrived in one cell. Then the cell beside it forgot what it had been" is description. The Process is the tool for achieving Law 3. When the series premise touches the narrative — reality being edited, overwritten, healed wrong, defended — describe what the biological process DOES in language specific to this episode and moment, without the medical label.

### Not Violations — Leave Alone

These are words doing their jobs. Frequency alone does not make them problems.

- **Subject-matter nouns:** "Building" in an architecture episode. "Frequency" in a CERN episode. "Memory" in a Mandela Effect episode. You cannot write about buildings without saying "building."

- **Spatial and temporal prepositions:** "Beneath" in an episode about buried floors. "Before" in an episode tracking chronology. These are structural, not experiential.

- **Action verbs for documented events:** "Demolished" when buildings were demolished. "Seized" when trunks were seized. These are what happened.

- **Emphasis and structure words:** "Never," "every," "same" — these are rhetorical tools. Their frequency reflects the narrator's patterns of emphasis, not craft failures.

### Earned Ambiguity — A Special Case

"Something" is not always a violation. When the narrator genuinely cannot identify what they're describing — when the ambiguity IS the experience — the word earns its place.

"Something passed through the room" works when the point is that the narrator doesn't know what it was. The not-knowing is the horror. That's not laziness. That's the narrator at the edge of what language can hold.

"Something twisted inside him" doesn't work because the writer DOES know what twisted. They just didn't do the work. The vagueness isn't the experience — it's the shortcut.

The distinction: Is the ambiguity intentional and serving the listener? Or is it a placeholder for specificity the writer owed but didn't deliver?

The writer's taste determines which is which. The Process is the tool they reach for when they decide the easy word isn't earning its place.

## How to Audit

<audit_protocol>
A term violation audit is not a search-and-replace operation. It is a read-through with a specific question in mind.

**Step 1: Identify candidates.** Run word counts. Flag any experiential word appearing more than eight times. Flag any instance of "felt," "watched," "something," or body-part emotion regardless of count.

**Step 2: Read each instance in context.** For every flagged instance, read the paragraph before, the paragraph containing it, and the paragraph after. Ask: Is this word doing its job here? Is it the right word, or the easy word?

**Step 3: Decide.** Some instances stay. They're earning their place. Mark them and move on. Some instances are violations — the writer reached for a label instead of building the experience. These get The Process applied.

**Step 4: Apply The Process only where needed.** Name the concept. Read the territory. Write toward meaning. Check for new violations. Read aloud. Verify the fit. Do not attempt to fix every instance in a single pass. Fix the ones that matter most — the ones where a richer image would deepen the listener's experience.

**What this is not:** A purge. A synonym hunt. An attempt to hit zero on any word count. The goal is not fewer words. The goal is fewer shortcuts.

## The Borderline

<borderline_cases>
Some words live between categories. They're fine in some uses and lazy in others.

- **"Old":** "The old building" is sometimes fine. But "the ornament-heavy facades from before the century turned" creates an image where "old" creates nothing. Audit for lazy uses where a more specific description would serve the listener.

- **"Same":** "The same pattern" is structural. "The same grief" is a label violation — "grief" is the problem, and "same" is enabling it.

- **"Version":** "The accepted version" repeated four times becomes a formulaic crutch. The word itself isn't experiential, but the phrase is becoming a tic. Vary the framing.

- **"Silence":** "The silence was heavy" is a violation — what IS the silence? "The room returned nothing — no settling, no hum of pipes, no click of radiators" is the experience of silence without the label. But "silence fell" as a beat between dialogue lines is structural and fine.

For borderline cases, the question remains the same: Is a more specific image available that would create a richer experience? If yes, do the work. If the word is carrying its weight, leave it alone.
