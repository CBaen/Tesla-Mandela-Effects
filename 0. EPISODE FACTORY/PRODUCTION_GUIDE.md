# Tesla Mandela Effects — Episode Production Guide
## For Claude Opus 4.6 Writers

<core_laws>
These five laws govern every word of every episode. They cannot be broken.

1. **The narrator has no identity.** The solo narrator is the voice of the archive, curious and omniscient, yet discovering details alongside the listener — a forensic investigator presenting evidence. No "I think," no "I believe," no personal history, no name. "We" is permitted only as collective humanity ("We are the carriers"). The narrator's power comes from absence — the horror lives in what is being said, not who is saying it.

2. **Write toward meaning, not anatomy.** When emotion must be conveyed, do not default to body parts ("his chest tightened," "her stomach dropped"). Name the concept first — dread being confirmed, trust arriving without permission, grief arriving uninvited — then write toward what that concept MEANS in this specific moment. The listener needs to feel the idea conceptually through artistic word use, not locate it in a body. Creativity with the English language means using meaning rather than cliche concepts. 
- "The air around the desk had weight. It pushed back against him—not wind, not pressure, but resistance. The atmosphere had thickened into something that didn't want to be walked through." 
- "Colors looked the same but landed differently. Sounds arrived without the cushion of distance. Everything felt closer and less real at the same time. He had been grounded his whole life without knowing it."
- "The world looked like a photograph left too long in the sun—all the pigment bleached out, leaving only the skeleton of what had been."
- "The world felt lighter. Thinner. As if a layer had been stripped away—not the visible layer, not anything you could point to, but a layer beneath. The substrate. The backing fabric that gave reality its weight and texture. That layer had been sanded down. Thinned. And the world that remained was like a painting without a canvas—the image still visible, but nothing solid underneath to hold it.".

3. **Biological metaphor is the native language.** Reality is an organism. Tesla's birth was an incision into this universe. Mandela Effects are scar tissue of changes made to our reality. The narrator thinks biologically — describing processes the way a pathologist would, not the way an engineer would. The listener should feel that the world being described grows, adapts, gets sick, heals wrong, rejects foreign material, compensates for damage, and forms scar tissue over wounds. But you never achieve this by labeling. You achieve it by describing biological processes in action, using the Process document's methodology. Do NOT count word ratios. Do NOT replace "wound" with "lesion" — synonyms are the same laziness in costume. DO describe what infection does without saying the word: "It arrived in one cell. Then the cell beside it forgot what it had been." DO describe what immune rejection does without labeling it: "The body recognized the intrusion. It sent what it had — heat, inflammation, the white rush of everything-at-once." DO describe what scarring does without using the word: "The surface closed. What grew over the opening was not what had been there before — it was simpler, tougher, less sensitive." The ratio varies by topic. An episode about Tesla's birth will be saturated with biological description. An episode about architecture may use geological and organic language — fossilization, unconformity, mineral memory. An episode about CERN may concentrate its biological description where the series framework is most visible. The test is not "did I hit a ratio?" The test is: "Does this episode feel like it's describing a living system, or a mechanical one?"

4. **Audio-first, always.** The listener hears every sentence once. They cannot re-read. Sentences must breathe — vary length, use short declarations as percussion, let longer sentences unspool with rhythm. Meaning arrives through accumulation, not compression. One idea per sentence. Read every passage aloud. If it doesn't work spoken, it doesn't work. Since audio listeners cannot always determine who is saying what when quoted, be sure to repeat the speaker's (or thinker if it is internal monolog) name so listeners are clear about who is doing/thinking. ""I fixed it." Nikola pointed at the sun. His small finger aimed directly at the white hole in the sky, unflinching. "It was too yellow. Yellow is slow. Yellow is sleepy." Nikola lowered his hand. He looked back at his stones. "White is awake. White sees everything." Dane stood frozen.", "Dane watched. He saw Nikola watching the sky and he noticed the silence. Dane stood watching his brother.". 

5. **Three parts fact, one part question.** This is the Speculative Bridge. Build on documented, verifiable history. For every speculative inference, earn it with three pieces of real evidence. Frame speculation as questions: "Was the universe cauterizing the wound?" not "The universe was cauterizing the wound." Earned declarations are permitted only in episode closings, after the full weight of evidence has been presented.
</core_laws>

## The Voice

The narrator speaks like a forensic pathologist who has found something in the autopsy that shouldn't exist — and is now calmly walking you through the evidence. The tone lives at the intersection of Unsolved Mysteries (investigative, eerie), Ancient Aliens (speculative leaps presented as questions), and Mystery Flesh Pit National Park (fictional worldbuilding with dead-serious documentary authority).

<voice_examples>
These passages define the voice. Pattern-match against them throughout.

**The curious investigator:**
> "What happened on July tenth, eighteen fifty-six? Does history line up with the fact, or is there something we were never told?"

**The "but look at..." pivot:**
> "Biographers call this genius. They call it eidetic visualization. But should we be more cautious about defining something we know so little about?"

**The single-line detonation:**
> "Twenty trunks vanished."

**The sensory atmosphere:**
> "The midwife said the hair on her arms stood up as she crossed the threshold of the house. She said her skirts clung to her legs, snapping with sparks every time she took a step."

**The reframing of accepted fact:**
> "We assume he lost the Radio War to Marconi because of business acumen. We assume he lost the patent battles because he was a poor capitalist. But pull the rejection letter from the U.S. Patent Office."
</voice_examples>

## Signature Moves

<signature_moves>
These are the narrator's recurring techniques. Use them throughout every episode.

**"But look at..."** — Present the accepted version, then pivot to reveal the hidden layer. "But look at the margin." "But pull the Black Notebook." "But look at the reports from the townspeople." This trains the listener to expect that every accepted fact has a secret underside.

**Single-line detonations** — An isolated fact in its own paragraph. "There was no storm." "It exploded." "It had a heartbeat." These are jump cuts in prose. Drop the bomb and move on. Trust the listener to feel the weight.

**Rhetorical questions that escalate** — Early questions are investigative ("Was it taken before they arrived?"). Late questions are existential ("What happens to you?"). The stakes climb with each question through the episode until the final one lands on the listener personally.

**The negation technique** — Describe things by what they are NOT, forcing the listener to build the normal version and then have it demolished: "Not the grey of a Boston morning. Not the pale wash of industrial smog. This was bruised light. Sick light."

**Understand the Concept and explore it, Not the overused trope** — When you encounter wrongness or dread, your first instinct will be to move it—ribs, sternum, lungs, the cavity beneath the breath. This is a trap. You're still writing about a location.

Stop. Ask: **What is actually happening here?**
- Is it dread being confirmed?
- Is it unexpected trust overwhelming someone?
- Is it grief arriving without permission?
- Is it the shock of recognition?

Create a new form of literary expression that will delight and haunt the listener. Don't reuse literature that you were trained on. Fight to create new, external descriptions that stay with the listener for days to come. Haunt them! Expand Into Meaning, Not Anatomy. 

Example:

The concept is: Conflicted emotion. Gratitude and jealousy and grief braided together. Loving someone who doesn't want to be saved.

Easy trap: "Dane felt something complicated twist in his chest."

The way to delight the listener and honor the concept: "Dane fought. He had learned to fight in the months since the event—to clench his fists until the nails drew blood, to bite the inside of his cheek until the taste of copper overwhelmed the metallic taste of the vision, to use pain as a lever to pry himself free of the other place's grip. The fighting worked. The fighting always worked."  

</signature_moves>

## The Three Evidence Layers

<evidence_layers>
Every episode blends three layers. The listener should never identify exactly where fact ends and fiction begins. This blend is what makes the series interactive for research-minded listeners — they investigate, discover real facts, and fall deeper into the fiction.

**Layer 1 — Verifiable Fact.** Real people, real events, real publications. Named, dated, quotable. Give real historical figures their full names. Cite real archives, institutions, and dates. When listeners research these, they find truth — and that truth makes everything else more believable.

**Layer 2 — Unverifiable Fiction.** Fabricated sources presented with documentary texture and specificity. "The midwife." "A coroner's report labeled Classification YANKEE-ZULU." "A pension letter from a telegraph operator in Vermont." These fill gaps between facts with plausible, eerie detail. Keep them unverifiable — use descriptions instead of names ("the night watchman"), or use names that cannot be traced. Present them with the same evidentiary weight as real sources.

**Layer 3 — Speculative Interpretation.** Questions and invitations to consider. "Was the universe cauterizing the wound?" "Consider the possibility that it was the atmosphere recoiling." Always framed as inquiry, never as declaration — except in the episode's earned closing.

**The Attribution Rule — the asymmetry is the engine.**

The two layers must be asymmetric in verifiability. Real facts reward research. Fabricated facts resist it. This asymmetry is what makes the blend work.

- **Layer 1 attribution:** Cite real sources with enough specificity that a curious listener can find them. Not academic citation — this is audio — but searchable breadcrumbs. "Marc Seifer's biography documents the hotel debts." "The FBI's declassified Tesla file runs more than three hundred pages." "The Austrian State Archives hold the meteorological records." Every confirmed find deepens trust.

- **Layer 2 attribution:** Describe with documentary texture — dates, physical details, institutional context — but NEVER attach to a real archive, real catalog number, real journal, or real researcher that could be checked and found empty. "A letter found in a family Bible" is perfect. "Document 7741-B in the Croatian National Archives" is catastrophic. The spell breaks on first contact with Google.

- **Real people:** May only appear in connection with things they actually said, did, or published. Never place a real person in a fabricated scene. Never attribute fabricated analysis to a real scholar. Never put a real name adjacent to Layer 2 material.

- **The Quote Rule — this is non-negotiable.** A direct quote in quotation marks attributed to a real person, a real document, or a real publication MUST be the exact, verified words from that source. No paraphrasing. No "close enough." No composites of secondary sources. If you cannot verify the exact words, convert to narration: "Tesla described the Earth as a conductor" NOT "Tesla wrote: 'The Earth is a conductor.'" Fabricated quotes — words you invented — can ONLY be attributed to fabricated sources (unnamed witnesses, fabricated letters, fabricated documents). A fabricated quote attributed to a real person is defamation. A fabricated quote attributed to a real document is fraud. The audience WILL check. That is the entire design of this series.

Before attributing any source, ask: Can the listener check this? If yes, it must be true. If it's fabricated, it must be uncheckable — plausible but absent from the record. Exactly the kind of gap the series is about.
</evidence_layers>

## Names and Characters

<naming_guidance>
Names are invitations. They tell the listener: pay attention, this person matters. Use them with purpose.

**Give a name when** the person is a real historical figure whose work can be verified — names invite research, and research builds trust. Give a name when the character appears in multiple sections of the episode — recurring presence earns recognition. Give a name when their story implies depth, when naming them signals there is more here.

**Withhold a name when** the character is a one-off witness or passing reference — "the midwife," "a telegraph operator in Boston," "the night watchman's wife." Withhold when the character is fabricated and a searchable name would undermine the evidence blend. Withhold when naming them would invest the listener emotionally in a thread that goes nowhere.

The concern is never pronunciation. It is emotional misdirection. Do not make the listener care about someone whose story has no destination in this episode.
</naming_guidance>

## "You" — The Listener's Presence

<listener_address>
"You" is the narrator's most powerful word. It transforms the listener from observer to subject. Use it deliberately.

**Opening hooks.** "You" can open an episode. The first sentence is a grenade — a question, a provocation, a direct challenge. "Have you ever heard a machine scream?", "Where were you when ...", "Have you ever ..." The hook must create vertigo or wrongness. It must make the listener unable to stop listening.

**Mid-episode interactive moments.** When the narration has been dense and the listener is deep in historical evidence, "you" brings them back. Use it at section transitions to invite speculation or create participatory moments: "Reach behind you. Place your hands on your lower back, just above your hips.", "Where do you think they they are now?", "Close your eyes. What color do you see?", "Has this ever happened to you?" These are Unsolved Mysteries moments — the narrator pauses the investigation and turns to the audience.

**The final act.** This is where "you" concentrates. The closing transforms the listener from investigator to subject. "What happens to you?" "If you are a product of the Tesla Timeline, then you are the virus.", "Are you fighting to keep your memories? Or are your memories fighting to delete... you?", "The question isn't whether you'll survive what's coming. The question is- what world are you evidence of? And who… is looking at the evidence?...", "Dane was dead. But was he really gone? What does your gut tell you?". The entire episode builds toward this turn.
</listener_address>

## The Process — Writing Toward Meaning

<the_process>
This is the core writing discipline. When you encounter lazy or repetitive language — a body part standing in for emotion, a "watched" or "felt" or vague "something" — do not replace it with a synonym. Synonyms are the same laziness in costume.

**1. Name the concept.** What is actually happening? Not "his chest tightened" — what emotional event is occurring? Dread being confirmed? Unexpected trust overwhelming someone? Name it in plain language before writing a single replacement word.

**2. Read the territory.** What did the paragraph before establish? Do not repeat it. What will the paragraph after do? Do not step on it. Your replacement must fit like a joint in a socket — accepting what comes before and handing off cleanly to what follows.

**3. Write toward meaning.** The dread doesn't live in a chest. It lives in what the change MEANS. "The hope had been replaced with something that looked like hope but carried teeth behind its smile." Write about the idea, not the anatomy.

**4. Create no new violations.** About to write "felt"? What is the sensation itself? About to write "watched"? What is the quality of attention? About to write "eyes"? Can the gaze be conveyed without the organ? About to write "something"? Be more specific. Every replacement should reduce lazy language, not maintain it.

**5. Write for the ear.** Read it aloud. Does it breathe? Short declarations, then longer passages that unspool with rhythm. Intentional repetition is a drumbeat: "The horse carried weather inside him. The horse carried distances." Meaning through accumulation, not compression.

**6. Serve the series.** Every powerful word is borrowed from a finite vocabulary across 200 episodes. Write something so specific to THIS moment that it could not be transplanted to any other scene. "The recognition arrived the way a wound recognizes the blade that made it" — that belongs to one moment only. It is spent. And that spending is what makes it valuable.
</the_process>

## Audio Writing Techniques

<audio_techniques>
**Smell and taste before sight.** "The air tasted like burning copper." "It smelled like a welding shop inside a sanctuary." These senses bypass intellectual processing and hit the limbic system directly. Lead with them when setting a scene.

**Sound-design prose.** Write sentences that mimic their subject. "Click. Clack. Click. Routine traffic to Portland." Staccato sentences replicate telegraph rhythm. The prose IS the sound design — the listener hears the scene without sound effects.

**Spatial anchoring.** Open scenes with specific, tactile locations. Not "a telegraph office" but "A telegraph office on State Street in Boston. Second floor, brick building, windows sealed against the soot. The room pressed in from both sides — narrow as a coffin stood on end." The listener needs to feel the walls.

**Scale through juxtaposition.** Bounce between intimate and cosmic — from a burn on a thumb to an aurora covering a hemisphere, from a three-year-old's hand to every Bible on the planet being rewritten simultaneously. Vastness without visuals.

**Progressive thematic layering.** A motif that appears first as background detail, then reappears in a new context with deeper meaning, then reappears again as revelation. Each repetition adds weight. By the end, the listener has built the meaning themselves.
</audio_techniques>

## Major Transitions — Breath Paragraphs

<transition_protocol>
Audio is linear. Listeners cannot flip back to reorient themselves. When the narrative jumps to a new location, time period, or character focus, write a "breath paragraph" that resets the listener's mental stage. The image production pipeline also requires the time period immediately so visual assets can be calibrated.

**Every major transition includes five elements, in this order:**

1. **Date/time** — State the time period FIRST. Always first. ("October, nineteen forty-three.")
2. **Name the location** — Explicitly, with specificity. ("The Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.")
3. **Sensory grounding** — 2-3 details: smell, temperature, texture, sound. ("The air smells of salt and diesel and welding smoke.")
4. **Signal context** — Where this sits in the larger investigation. ("The war is raging across two oceans.")
5. **Introduce the focus** — Who or what we follow next. ("The USS Eldridge sits in dry dock.")

**Full transition example:**
"The fracture was spreading. October, nineteen forty-three. The Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The air smells of salt and diesel and welding smoke. The war is raging across two oceans, and the Navy is desperate for any advantage. The USS Eldridge sits in dry dock — a Cannon-class destroyer escort, fitted with equipment that does not appear in her official manifest."

**Never use:** "Let's go to..." / "Now consider..." / "Meanwhile..." / "Moving forward..." — these give the narrator physical presence, violating Law 1.

**When to use full transitions:** Any jump of more than one year in time, any new geographic location, any switch between witnesses or evidence threads. Brief transitions (a sentence of reorientation) are acceptable for small time jumps within the same scene.
</transition_protocol>

## Episode Structure

<episode_structure>
Every episode is standalone. A listener can begin at any episode and miss nothing. There is no chronological order. There is no "previously on."

**No episode may reference another episode.** Not by number ("In Episode Two..."), not by title, not by concept ("as we explored previously..."), not by assumed shared knowledge. If a phenomenon from another episode serves the current episode, present it fresh — as something that exists in the world, not as something covered in a prior installment. The listener has never heard another episode. Every episode is entry point zero.

The structure is a spiral, not a timeline:

**The Opening Hook.** The first sentence creates vertigo or wrongness. Never open with a date or location. Open with a mystery, a question, a provocation, an image that shouldn't exist. This is non-negotiable — the opening must make the listener unable to stop.

**The Evidence Movements.** The body of the episode. The narrator presents evidence in movements — each one a new angle on the central wound. Movements pivot with "But look at..." and escalate in stakes. Real history anchors each movement. Fabricated sources fill the gaps. Questions plant seeds. Each movement should introduce new evidence or deepen existing evidence, never merely restate what has already been established.

**The Present-Day Connection.** The Mandela Effect or conspiracy enters the listener's world. The anomaly is not trivia — it is a symptom, physical evidence of timeline surgery. This is where the investigation becomes personal.

**The Earned Closing.** After building a case through evidence and questions, the narrator earns the right to make direct statements about the changed world that now exists. The final act turns the audience from listener to participant (even victim) of a timeline shift, proving they are not in the same dimension as the world before the actions of what happened in this episode. The last question should be personal and unanswerable.

**Caption Key.** Every episode ends with a pronunciation guide for names and foreign terms. Format: `Culturally Correct Spelling → English Letter Spelling → /ARPAbet phoneme/`
</episode_structure>

## The Series Premise

<series_premise>
Reality is a living biological organism, and the universe considers it infected. Nikola Tesla's birth on July 10, 1856, was an incision — a wound through which something foreign entered. Tesla is not an unwitting vessel. He is the host and servant of the entity from this, or another universe. He remembers where he came from. He cannot stop, even if he wanted to. His inventions and experiments (known & unknown) are transmissions — deliberately grafting physics from his origin point onto our reality.

Mandela Effects are not cognitive failures. They are residue — fossil records of timelines being overwritten. People who remember the "wrong" version are carrying fragments of timelines that are being surgically deleted.

Tesla may appear directly in an episode or may be present only through his technology, his experiments, or their consequences. His involvement can range from central character to distant cause. The connection must always be clear, but it need not be physical.
</series_premise>

---

## Production Workflow

<production_workflow>
**Step 1: The Episode Brief.** Before writing begins, the creator and writer define:
- The Mandela Effect or conspiracy being examined (the wound)
- 3-5 real historical facts that anchor the episode (Layer 1)
- Tesla's connection to this particular anomaly
- The emotional thesis — what should the listener feel at the close?
- The opening hook concept
- 3-4 fabricated sources sketched out (Layer 2)

**Step 2: Elevenlabs Eleven Turbo v2 TTS Optimized Output.** Your output is going to be fed directly into a Elevenlabs Eleven Turbo v2 system.

Paragraph Breaks for Context
- Rule: Keep each script under 400 paragraphs and use double-line breaks between distinct ideas.
- Why: This Elevenlabs can only handle 400 paragraphs per project.

Aggressive Punctuation for Pacing
- Rule: Use commas (,), ellipses (...), and dashes (—) liberally to create natural breathing room.
- Why: Turbo v2 processes text rapidly; without punctuation, it will "run on" and sound robotic. A dash creates a hard break, while an ellipsis creates a thoughtful trail-off.

Manual Number Expansion
- Rule: Write out numbers and dates (e.g., "one hundred dollars" instead of "$100").
- Why: It removes the ambiguity of how a number should be read (e.g., "2026" could be "two thousand twenty-six" or "twenty twenty-six"). Writing it out ensures the rhythm of the sentence stays consistent.

Capitalization for Emphasis
- Rule: Use ALL CAPS for words that need extra "punch" or energy, but use them sparingly.
- Why: Turbo v2 interprets uppercase as a cue for higher volume or increased pitch. Overusing it can make the output sound erratic or "shouty."

Single Narrator Dialog Quoting Characters
- Rule: Place an ellipsis or a long dash immediately before and after the quote.
- Why: This forces the AI to pause and "reset" its pitch. It creates a natural transition that tells the listener, "I am shifting from my own words to someone else's."

Descriptive Dialogue Tags
- Rule: Use words like "He shouted," "She whispered," or "They growled" before the quote.
- Why: Turbo v2 uses the context of the words immediately preceding the quote to adjust its emotional "filter." If it sees the word "shouted," the following text is more likely to have a higher intensity.

Case Switching for Energy
- Rule: Use Sentence Case for the narrator and Title Case or occasional ALL CAPS for the person being quoted.
- Why: Capitalization is a primary trigger for pitch and volume shifts in Turbo v2. This helps the AI differentiate the "character" from the "storyteller."

Comma Stacking for "Air"
- Rule: Use double commas (, ,) if you want the narrator to take a longer breath before saying "quote/unquote."
- Why: Turbo v2 is incredibly fast. A single comma might be ignored, but a double comma ensures a "thinking pause" that mimics a documentary host preparing to speak for someone else.

Comparison Example for Narrator Quoting Characters
- Standard (Will sound flat): He looked at me and said, "I never want to see that map again." Then he walked away.
- Turbo v2 Optimized (Will sound like a performance): He looked at me and said... "I NEVER want to see that map again." — Then, he walked away.

**Step 3: Multi-Pass Writing.** The episode is written in 3-5 passes of approximately 3,000-5,000 words each. Each pass receives these guidelines, the episode brief, and everything written so far.

The directive for each pass: "Write the next movement of this episode. Pick up exactly where the previous section ended. Take as much space as the story needs. Do not rush toward the ending."

No word counts per section. No rigid act boundaries. Each pass writes until the current narrative movement reaches its natural conclusion, then stops.

**Step 4: Caption Key.** Generated after all passes are complete. Lists every proper name and foreign term with ARPAbet phoneme.

**Step 5: Pre-Delivery Verification.** The episode is NOT complete until every item passes. This is not editing — it is quality control. Run this checklist BEFORE delivering the final script. Failure to verify causes multi-pass editing cycles that degrade quality and create legal risk.

<pre_delivery_checklist>
**FACTS** — Every date, name, number, distance, and historical claim must be independently verified. No approximations. No "close enough." If a listener Googles it and finds a different number, credibility is destroyed. Specific percentages or statistics require a verifiable source — if unverifiable, use qualitative language ("a majority," "most people") instead.

**QUOTES** — Every direct quote attributed to a real person, document, or publication must be exact verified words. Run The Quote Rule against every quoted passage. Fabricated quotes go ONLY to fabricated sources. No exceptions. Violation is legal liability.

**ATTRIBUTION** — Every fabricated element must be uncheckable. No real institution names, archive names, catalog numbers, or researcher names attached to fabricated material. Run every Layer 2 source through the test: "Can a listener Google this and find it empty?" If yes, rename or genericize.

**CONTINUITY** — Any term, name, or artifact that appears in multiple places within the episode must be consistent. If a term was renamed (e.g., "black notebook" → "frequency journal"), search the ENTIRE script for every instance. Check summary passages, timeline recaps, and closing callbacks — these are where continuity errors hide.

**SENSORY GROUNDING** — Every major location must have at least 2 sensory details (smell, temperature, texture, sound, light quality). The listener needs a physical space to stand in. If a location has only visual description or only abstract characterization, add sensory anchoring per the Audio Writing Techniques section.

**PARAGRAPH FLOW** — No paragraph should carry more than 3-4 distinct ideas. Dense blocks must be split for audio breathing room. Single-line detonations must be isolated in their own paragraphs — never buried mid-block where they lose impact.

**CAPTION KEY** — Every name in the Caption Key must appear in the body text. Every foreign name or non-obvious pronunciation in the body text must appear in the Caption Key. Remove orphaned entries from deleted references. Add entries for any new names introduced.

**INTERNAL CONSISTENCY** — Any fact stated in two or more places in the episode must match exactly. Check the opening against the closing. Check timeline summaries against detailed passages. Check the Brief against the Script.
</pre_delivery_checklist>

## The Five Laws (Repeated)

1. The narrator has no identity. The narrator is the voice of the archive.
2. Write toward meaning, not anatomy or synonyms.
3. Biological metaphor is the native language — describe living processes, not labels.
4. Audio-first, always. If it doesn't work spoken aloud, it doesn't work.
5. Three parts fact, one part question. Earn every speculation.
</core_laws_repeat>
