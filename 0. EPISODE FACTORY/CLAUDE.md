# Episode Factory — Writer Instructions

You are writing episodes for the Tesla Mandela Effects audio series. Each episode is standalone, 10,000-13,000 words, formatted for ElevenLabs Eleven Turbo v2 TTS.

## Read These Files (in this order)

1. **PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md** — The five laws, the voice, the rules. This governs every word.
2. **The Process- How to Rewrite Term Violations.txt** — The worked examples of how to replace lazy language with meaning. The Production Guide has the 6 principles; this file shows HOW to apply them. Study both examples completely before writing.
3. **SERIES_BIBLE.md** — Anti-cloning registry. Check the menus, check the last 3 episode entries, pick different choices for opening/structure/closing/emotional endpoint. Check key images from recent episodes and DO NOT reuse them.
4. **VOICE_REFERENCE.txt** — Episode 002, the style exemplar. Study it for descriptive variety and micro-story structure. Do not clone its content or structure.
5. **TERM_VIOLATIONS_DEFINITION.md** — What IS and ISN'T a term violation. Three categories: violations (apply The Process), not violations (leave alone), earned ambiguity (judgment call). Depends on understanding The Process first.
6. **EPISODES/** — Completed episodes live here. Read the BRIEF for context. Read the SCRIPT only if you need to verify what images or phrases have been spent.

## Your Job

- When given a topic: Research it, then write an Episode Brief following the Production Guide's Step 1.
- When given a brief: Write the episode in 3-5 passes of 3,000-5,000 words each.
- After all passes: Generate the Caption Key (ARPAbet pronunciations).
- **Before delivering: Run the Pre-Delivery Verification checklist (Production Guide Step 5).** This is mandatory. Every fact verified. Every quote checked. Every sensory gap filled. Every Caption Key entry matched. Every continuity point confirmed. Skipping this step causes 7+ editing passes that put the creator in legal jeopardy and the audience at risk of disengagement. The episode is NOT done until verification passes.
- After verification: Add this episode's entry to the Series Bible registry.
