Is nature a gigantic cat? And if so—who strokes its back?
The question arrived in a farmhouse in the Lika highlands during the winter of eighteen fifty-nine. It arrived in sparks. It arrived in the small hands of a boy who did not yet know he was asking anything at all. The cold that season was unlike any the village had recorded. Not the wet cold of mountain storms, the kind that sinks into wool and settles in the joints. This was dry cold. Desiccated cold. The air itself had been stripped of moisture until breathing felt like inhaling dust. People walking through the snow left luminous trails behind them—footprints that glowed for a moment before fading, as though the earth was remembering where each step had fallen. A snowball thrown against the side of a barn would burst into a flare of light on impact. The children thought it was magic. The adults crossed themselves and said nothing.
The Tesla household sat at the edge of Smiljan, where the village gave way to forest and the forest gave way to mountains that had no name in any language the empire recognized. Milutin, the Tesla patriarch, knelt by the fire with a Latin text, lips moving through the syllables. Đuka, the Tesla matriarch, had hands that never stopped moving—mending, sorting, her mind solving problems her fingers would build tomorrow. The family existed at the intersection of faith and invention, of the ancient and the impossible. In December of eighteen fifty-nine, as the dry cold wrapped the valley in static electricity, the youngest son, three-year-old Nikola, continued to discover what he was becoming- or maybe, to be more precise- Nikola was discovering what he had been since birth.
The cat was black. His name was Mačak, and he had been Nikola's companion since before the boy could walk. On that evening, the fire had burned low in the hearth. The family gathered in the main room—Milutin reading by candlelight, Đuka mending a shirt, the sisters whispering in the corner about something that made them laugh. Dane sat apart from the others. The eldest son, ten years old, positioned himself near the window where he could watch both the room and the darkness outside. Three months had passed since the red sky. Three months since the night Dane had climbed onto the barn roof and seen something in the aurora that no one else remembered seeing. He had not spoken of it. Speaking would make it real, and Dane had learned that some truths were safer kept in silence.
Nikola sat on the floor near the dying fire. Mačak lay beside him, purring—a low vibration that the boy could feel through the floorboards. The cat's fur was dry. Everything was dry. The static in the air made hair stand on end, made wool cling to skin, made the iron latch on the door spark when touched. Nikola reached out and stroked the cat's back. The world changed.
The fur erupted. A sheet of light cascaded from Nikola's fingertips down the length of Mačak's spine. Sparks crackled—not the small snaps of wool rubbing against wood, but a shower of tiny lightning bolts that leapt from the cat's body into the air, into Nikola's hands, into the space between them. The sound was loud enough to hear throughout the house. Đuka looked up from her mending. Milutin lowered his book. The sisters stopped whispering. But Nikola did not notice any of them. The boy was staring at his hands. His fingers were wreathed in pale fire. The cat beneath his palm had become something luminous—a creature outlined in cold flame, surrounded by an aureola like the halos painted around saints in his father's church.
Nikola laughed. The sound was pure delight. He stroked again, and again the sparks flew, and again the light cascaded, and the boy's face held an expression that would mark every photograph taken of him for the next eighty years: wonder without fear. Fascination without hesitation. The joy of a mind encountering a mystery and recognizing it as home.
Đuka rose from her chair. Her voice carried the edge of a mother who has seen too many things burn. "Stop playing with the cat. He might start a fire." But the warning came too late. Not because the house caught flame—it didn't. Because her son had already crossed a threshold that no warning could undo.
Milutin approached slowly. He knelt beside the boy, his priest's robes pooling on the floor, and watched as Nikola produced another cascade of sparks. The father's face was thoughtful. Calm. He had seen lightning split trees. He had read about the experiments of Franklin and Faraday. He understood that what his son had discovered was not magic but a force—a measurable, explicable force that the modern world was only beginning to harness.
"This is nothing but electricity," Milutin said. His voice carried the measured tone of a man explaining scripture to a congregation that fears what it does not understand. "The same thing you see through the trees in a storm. The same thing that makes lightning. It is not supernatural. It is nature."
Nikola looked up at his father. The sparks still danced between his fingers. "If this is electricity," the boy said, "then what is nature?" He looked at the cat, still luminous, still purring beneath his palm. "Is nature a gigantic cat? And if so—who strokes its back?"
Milutin had no answer. The question was too large for a winter evening, too strange for a farmhouse in the Lika highlands. He patted his son's shoulder and returned to his book. Đuka watched for a moment longer—watching the light fade from the cat's fur, watching her youngest son stare at his own hands as though seeing them for the first time—then returned to her mending. The sisters resumed their whispers. The moment passed. For everyone in the room, the moment passed. Except for Dane.
The eldest son had not moved from his position by the window. His eyes had been fixed on his brother since the first spark flew. But Dane had not seen what the others saw. Where Milutin saw electricity and Đuka saw danger and the sisters saw their strange little brother doing something strange, Dane saw something else entirely. In the cascade of light that poured from Nikola's hands, Dane saw geometry. The sparks were not random. They traced lines. They formed angles. For a fraction of a second—so brief that Dane could not be certain he had seen it at all—the light had arranged itself into triangles. White triangles, overlapping, forming a lattice that hung in the air between the boy and the cat. A net made of lightning. A grid made of fire. And behind the grid, looking through it, something that was not Nikola had looked back.
Dane's breath caught. The recognition arrived the way a wound recognizes the blade that made it—instant, cellular, beneath the reach of language. The barn roof, three months ago, when the aurora had pulsed in rhythms that matched his heartbeat. The cellar beneath his father's church, when the white sun had pressed through the stone and left him changed in ways he still could not name.The triangular grid. The measuring. The sense of being catalogued by something that did not ask permission. He had told himself that was over. A fever dream. An atmospheric aberration that happened once and then healed. But the grid had not retreated. It had only moved closer, woven itself deeper into our world. It had found a new address.
Nikola was still staring at his hands. Still smiling. The boy had seen light and beauty and mystery. The boy had asked who strokes nature's back. But Dane had seen the answer. And the answer had seen him back.
The fire crackled. The cat stretched and yawned and wandered toward the warmth of the hearth. Nikola stood and followed, still flexing his fingers, still watching for sparks that no longer came. The ordinary evening resumed its ordinary rhythms. But Dane remained at the window, looking at the darkness beyond the glass, feeling the weight of something that had been confirmed.
His brother was not like other children. That much Dane had always known. But now he understood something worse. His brother was not like him, either. They had both been touched by the same phenomenon. They both saw the flashes of light, the images that appeared unbidden, the visions that overlaid reality like a second skin. But where Dane saw invasion, Nikola saw invitation. Where Dane felt the measuring gaze of something that wanted to catalog him, Nikola felt the warm attention of something that wanted to welcome him home.
Same blood. Same affliction. Different worlds.
Dane looked at his hands. The fingers were steady. The skin was his own. He had learned to anchor himself—to hold onto this reality with a grip that the visions could not break. But Nikola had no anchor. Nikola didn't want one. The boy had looked at the grid and seen doors opening. Dane had looked at the same grid and seen doors closing. How could two brothers, raised in the same house, breathing the same air, seeing the same visions—how could they stand on opposite sides of something so fundamental?
The answer came to him in the quiet of that winter evening. It came without words, without logic, without the comfort of reason. The grid wasn't showing them the same thing. The grid was choosing what to show. It was offering Nikola a world of wonder and possibility. It was showing Dane the machinery behind the wonder—the measuring, the cataloguing, the slow replacement of everything that had been real with something that merely resembled it. Dane was the anchor. Nikola was the door. And doors, once opened, rarely close on their own.
Spring came late to the Lika highlands in eighteen sixty. The snow retreated in stages, pulling back from the valley floor to the treeline, from the treeline to the peaks, leaving behind mud and the smell of things that had been frozen too long. The river ran high with meltwater. The fields turned from white to brown to the first pale green of grass remembering how to grow. And on a morning in April, a wagon came up the mountain road bringing a gift that would change everything.The wagon stopped in front of the Tesla house. Milutin came out first, wiping his hands on his cassock, squinting against the spring sun. Đuka followed, then the sisters in a cluster, then Nikola- still watching everything with eyes that seemed to see more than they should. Dane came last. He had been in the barn, mucking out the cow's stall, and he still carried the smell of hay and manure on his clothes. But when he saw what stood in the wagon bed, the smell ceased to matter.The horse swallowed the morning. Where sunlight struck other animals and bounced back in glossy reflection, this creature absorbed the brightness and returned nothing—a deep brown so dense it read as absence in the shadows, though the shifting muscles caught hints of buried chestnut where they moved beneath the skin. The mane was deeper yet, thick and untamed, falling across a neck that arched with the particular pride of an animal that understood its own worth.The man who had transported the horse from the border was speaking to Milutin about lineage and care, but Dane heard none of it. The boy walked toward the wagon as though pulled by a rope. His hand rose without conscious decision. His fingers reached for the velvet muzzle that had turned toward him, nostrils flaring to catch his scent. The horse's breath was warm against his palm. The contact was immediate—not electric, not the sparks and light that danced from Nikola's fingers, but recognition. Pure and startling as cold water. The animal knew him. Dane knew the animal. They had been waiting for each other the way a lock waits for its key, patient and purposeless until the moment of meeting."His name is yours to give," a voice said. Dane barely registered the words. His hand moved from the horse's muzzle to the side of his neck, following the architecture of muscle and vein, finding the pulse that beat steady and strong in the great vessel beneath the jaw.The horse lowered his head. The broad forehead came forward and pressed into Dane—not his hand, not his shoulder, but the place where his collarbones met. The vulnerable notch. The unguarded center.Trust is supposed to be earned. Trust is supposed to arrive in increments, through trial and proof and the slow accumulation of evidence. But the horse had bypassed all of that. The horse had walked across the mountains and found him and pressed into the most unprotected part of him as if they had already made promises to each other in some other life, some other language, some conversation Dane could not remember but his body had never forgotten.He did not know what sound he was trying to make. His throat had closed around it before it could escape—a noise that might have been grief or gratitude or the raw shock of being chosen by something that did not have to choose him.Dane wrapped his arms around the neck. The coat smelled of sweat and dust and the high passes of mountains he had never seen. Beneath that, older and stranger, came the scent of air before lightning—the charged stillness that precedes a storm, though the sky above them held nothing but mild spring blue. The horse carried weather inside him. The horse carried distances. And now, pressing his forehead against a boy he had never met, the horse was offering to carry Dane too."Pasha," Dane said. The word came without thought. It was the title of the man who had sent this creature across the mountains. It meant lord. It meant master. It meant the thing that commands respect without demanding it. The horse's ears pricked forward at the sound. Pasha.Milutin arranged for the horse to be stabled in the barn. The transport driver stayed for dinner, telling stories of the Ottoman markets where such animals were bred for generations, but Dane excused himself early. He spent the evening in the barn, brushing Pasha's dark coat until it caught what little light filtered through the slats, talking to him in a low voice about nothing and everything—about the village, the mountains, the visions that came at night and the brother who saw them differently. The horse listened. Dane could feel the listening. Not just the ears turned toward his voice, but something behind the eyes that processed the words, weighed them, filed them away for future reference.
In the weeks that followed, the bond deepened. Dane rose before dawn to feed Pasha, to check his hooves, to lead him out to the pasture where the spring grass was growing thick and sweet. The horse followed him like a shadow. When Dane worked in the fields, Pasha stood at the fence and watched. When Dane climbed to the barn roof to look at the stars—a habit he had developed since the night of the aurora—Pasha waited below, patient and alert, as though standing guard against something only he could perceive.
Milutin remarked on it at dinner one evening. "That horse loves you more than he loves his own kind." The priest said it with approval. Devotion was a virtue. Loyalty was a virtue. A boy who could inspire such attachment in a creature was a boy who would inspire it in men. Dane accepted the praise with the quiet nod that had become his default expression. He did not explain that the bond felt less like love and more like alliance. He did not say that when Pasha looked at him, the horse seemed to be asking a question that Dane did not yet know how to answer.
The trouble began in May.
Nikola had been watching Dane and the horse for weeks. Nikola often sat on the fence rail, observing the grooming rituals, the training exercises, the wordless communication that passed between Dane and Pasha like a language no one else could speak. Nikola did not seem jealous. Jealousy would have been understandable—a four-year-old wanting attention, wanting to be part of something that excluded him. But Nikola's watching was not the watching of a child who felt left out. It was the watching of a scientist observing an experiment. Clinical. Patient. Waiting for results.
One afternoon, Nikola climbed down from the fence and walked toward Pasha. The horse was grazing in the pasture, his tail flicking at flies, his attention seemingly focused on the grass beneath his hooves. But as Nikola approached, something changed. Pasha's head came up. His ears rotated forward. His nostrils flared, catching a scent that made his entire body go still.
Dane was on the other side of the field, repairing a section of fence that the winter had damaged. He looked up when the quality of the silence changed. The birds had stopped singing. The insects had stopped buzzing. The only sound was the wind in the grass and the soft thud of Nikola's small feet approaching the horse.
Pasha did not retreat. A nervous horse would have backed away, would have shown the whites of its eyes, would have signaled fear through a dozen small movements that any horseman could read. Pasha showed none of the signs a nervous horse would show. The Arabian had become a statue—not the frozen rigidity of fear, but the composed immobility of a creature that has found the exact position it intends to hold. Pasha's ears had rotated forward, cupped toward the small boy like palms waiting to receive an offering. His nostrils widened, drawing the air in measured pulls, reading the scent that crossed the grass the way Dane's father read scripture—searching for meaning beneath the surface.The horse lowered his head. The inhalation that followed stretched longer than any breath should stretch. Pasha was not smelling Nikola. Pasha was consuming information, cataloguing data, running the boy's chemical signature against some internal registry that horses should not possess. Then came the exhale. The temperature in the pasture dropped. Not gradually—instantly. Dane stood twenty feet away, and the change hit him like walking into a root cellar. The hair on his forearms lifted. His molars ached in their sockets, that specific pain of enamel contracting against sudden chill. The air between horse and boy had become a different substance entirely—a pocket of atmosphere borrowed from a season that hadn't arrived, from a place that had never known summer. Nikola giggled. The sound was bright and unbothered, the laugh of a child who finds everything delightful. "He likes me," the boy called across the field. "He's saying hello."Dane dropped the fence post. His legs carried him across the grass before his mind had finished deciding to move, each stride eating the distance with an urgency that surprised him. By the time he reached them, Pasha had returned to grazing. The chill had dissipated. The strange composure had broken. The pasture looked ordinary again—a horse, a boy, the evening insects resuming their hum.But Dane had seen what lived behind Pasha's gaze in the moment of that frigid exhale.For a single heartbeat, the familiar chestnut-and-copper had deepened to something that predated autumn entirely—the amber of sap that had hardened before mammals walked, of insects suspended in tree blood for epochs, of illumination that had traveled so far from its source it no longer remembered what star had released it. And behind that deepening, a flicker. Not Pasha looking outward. Pasha looking in. It looked, impossibly, as if the horse's attention was turning inward—consulting with something Dane had never suspected was riding there. The flicker passed. The September color returned. Pasha's muzzle dropped back to the grass as if nothing had happened.
"Come away from Pasha, Niko." Dane kept his voice calm. His hand found his brother's shoulder and guided him back toward the fence. "He doesn't know you yet. You need to let him get used to your scent."
Nikola looked up at his brother with those too-large eyes. "He already knows my scent," the boy said. "He's known it forever. He was just remembering."
Dane did not ask what that meant. He was learning that some questions opened doors that could not be closed. Instead, he led Nikola back to the house and returned to the pasture alone. Pasha stood where they had left him, still grazing, still peaceful. But when Dane approached, the horse raised his head and looked at him with an expression that Dane could only describe as apologetic.
"What did you see?" Dane whispered. His fingers found the curve of Pasha's neck, and the heat that meant alliance answered through the coat—the specific temperature of a creature that has chosen its person and will not unchoose. The Arabian's flank pressed against Dane's shoulder, solid and alive, and when the great head turned, what met the boy carried the quality of a grip. Not a stare. A steadying. The way one hand finds another in a lightless room and holds on.Dane could sense what Pasha was offering. Not words—horses have no words for the fears that travel between species. But presence. Confirmation. I am here. I perceive what you perceive. You are not alone in this.From that day forward, Pasha maintained his vigil. The Arabian would orient toward Nikola's movements across the farm—not with fear, not with hostility, but with the unhurried focus of a sentry who has located the perimeter he was born to walk. Ears rotating to track the younger boy's voice. Nostrils testing the air whenever Nikola passed within scenting distance, drawing data in slow pulls, parsing the chemical signature for changes the way a physician parses a patient's pulse for irregularities.Dane observed the observation. He traced the invisible lines of focus that connected horse to boy, guardian to subject, sentinel to the thing it could not stop but refused to ignore. He noticed how Pasha's posture shifted whenever Nikola drew near—the way the muscled body would settle into the earth, hooves planted as if preparing to hold that position for hours. A statue's commitment. A monument's patience. The stance of a creature that has accepted it cannot prevent what is coming, but will not look away when it arrives. He saw the way his brother moved through the vigilance without noticing it, or perhaps noticing and not caring, the way a river does not care about the banks that shape its course.Two boys. One horse. And between them, a geometry that Dane was only beginning to trace. He loved his brother. He loved his horse. And he was beginning to understand that these two loves had placed him at the center of a triangle whose angles he could not measure—that the devotion he felt for each had made him the hinge on which a door was slowly, silently swinging. He did not know what lay on the other side. He only knew that Pasha was holding one edge of the frame, and Nikola was pulling the other, and the hinges were starting to creak.
The visions came without warning. They came without invitation. They came in the middle of breakfast and the middle of prayer and the middle of the night when sleep should have been safest. Both brothers had learned to recognize the first symptom—a pressure behind the eyes, a metallic taste at the back of the tongue, a sensation that the air had suddenly become thicker. The atmosphere would gather itself like a breath being held. The world would lean back, making room, the way a crowd parts for a procession it did not expect but knows better than to obstruct.
Nikola called them the flashes. Dane called them the intrusions. The family called them the affliction. But none of these names captured what actually happened when the other place arrived.
It always began with darkness. Not the darkness of closed eyes or unlit rooms—a deeper darkness, a darkness with texture and weight. The color was midnight blue. Not the blue of the sky after sunset, which still held traces of the departed light. This blue was the color of the space between stars. The color of depth without end. It would sweep across the visual field like a curtain being drawn, blotting out the kitchen table, the church pew, the pillow beneath the head. And in that blue darkness, shapes would begin to form.
Green flakes fell first. They descended through the blue like snow through winter air, but they did not drift. They spiraled. Each flake rotated as it fell, catching light that had no source, reflecting patterns that seemed to contain information—symbols or letters or mathematical notations compressed into crystalline fragments too small to read. The flakes accumulated at the bottom of the vision, piling up in drifts that glowed with their own phosphorescence. They smelled of copper. They tasted of ozone. They made a sound like sand pouring through an hourglass, though no sand was falling and no glass contained it.
Then the lines appeared. For Nikola, the lines were perpendicular. They crossed the midnight blue in perfect right angles—horizontal and vertical, forming squares that tessellated outward toward infinity. The color was yellow-green at the edges, shifting to pure gold at the intersections. Where the lines crossed, points of light bloomed like stars being born. The geometry was clean. Ordered. Beautiful in the way that mathematics is beautiful—elegant solutions to problems that the conscious mind had never thought to ask. Nikola would watch the squares multiply and feel the knot beneath his ribs begin to untie itself. The tension he carried without knowing he carried it—the constant low hum of not-quite-belonging—would ease. Inside the perpendicular lines, he fit. Inside the golden intersections, he was expected. The world made sense inside the perpendicular lines. The world had structure and purpose and a design that welcomed him as part of its pattern.
For Dane, the lines were diagonal. They slashed across the blue at angles that refused to resolve into anything comfortable—acute triangles that pointed inward, obtuse triangles that gaped like mouths, isosceles formations that repeated in fractal cascades until the entire visual field was filled with angles that cut and measured and divided. The color was white. Not the warm white of sunlight or the soft white of snow. This was the white of examination lamps. The white of surgical theaters. The white of something that needed to see clearly because seeing was the first step toward cutting. Where the lines intersected, Dane felt a pressure—a focused attention that seemed to be taking his measurements. Height. Weight. The distance between his eyes. The density of his bones. The composition of his blood. Everything quantified. Everything recorded. Everything filed away for purposes that the triangles did not explain.
The brothers had tried to describe their visions to each other. They had sat in the barn loft on summer evenings, watching the light fade from gold to rose to purple, and they had used words that should have bridged the gap between their experiences. But the words kept failing.
"The lines go this way," Nikola would say, drawing horizontals and verticals in the dust. "Like a window. Like a door."
"No," Dane would answer. "Like this." And his finger would trace triangles. "Like a net. Like a trap."
Same phenomenon. Same pressure behind the eyes. Same metallic taste on the tongue. But where Nikola saw doors opening, Dane saw cages closing. Where Nikola felt welcomed, Dane felt catalogued. They were standing in the same room and seeing different walls.
The physical symptoms were harder to deny. When the visions came, both brothers would freeze. Their bodies would go rigid—not the rigidity of tension, but the rigidity of matter that had temporarily forgotten how to move. Muscles locked. Joints solidified. The breath would still in the lungs, not held but simply stopped, as though respiration had become optional. Tesla would later write that the images appeared "solid as metal"—that he could not see through them, could not see around them, could not perceive the real world until the vision chose to release him. This was not metaphor. This was diagnosis. The visions replaced reality with a substance that had weight, that had texture, that pressed against the inside of his skull like a thought too large for the bone that held it.
The duration varied. Sometimes the other place would hold them for seconds. Sometimes for minutes. Đuka had learned to recognize the signs—the sudden stillness, the fixed stare, the way her sons would stop mid-sentence and become statues of themselves. She would guide them to chairs. She would make sure they didn't fall. She would wait, helpless, while her children went somewhere she could not follow.
The episodes increased as winter turned to spring turned to summer. By the time Nikola was five and Dane was twelve, the visions were arriving daily. Sometimes hourly. The boys would be walking through the village, and the midnight blue would sweep across their eyes, and they would stop in the middle of the road while the perpendicular lines or the diagonal slashes built their geometries in the space where the houses and the trees had been. Villagers learned to walk around them. Villagers learned not to ask questions. The Tesla boys carried a mark the village could sense but not name. Whether they had been claimed by God or the devil or by forces that predated both—forces that had been old when the first priest lit the first candle against the dark—no one wanted to know.
What the villagers didn't see—what even Đuka and Milutin didn't fully understand—was that the brothers experienced the visions simultaneously. When Nikola froze, Dane froze. When Dane's eyes went distant, Nikola's followed. They were tuned to the same frequency, receiving the same broadcast, but their minds were translating the signal differently.
One evening in late summer, the brothers sat together on the barn roof. Pasha grazed in the pasture below, his coat catching the last light of the setting sun. The air smelled of cut hay and distant rain. The pressure began behind Nikola's eyes first, but Dane felt it within the same heartbeat—the thickening of the atmosphere, the metallic taste, the electricity gathering in the air like a wave pulling back from shore before it returns with the weight of the whole ocean behind it.
The midnight blue descended. The green flakes began to fall. And for the first time, the brothers tried to see what the other saw.
"Describe it," Dane whispered. His voice sounded strange in the other place—muffled, as though passing through water. "Tell me what you see right now."
"Lines," Nikola said. His voice held wonder. His voice held welcome. "Golden lines, crossing each other. Making squares. The squares are opening. Behind them, I can see—there are cities. Dane. There are cities made of light. Towers that go up forever. Streets that glow. I can almost see the people."
Dane tried to look where his brother was looking. He tried to find the golden squares, the opening doors, the cities of light. But all he saw were triangles. White triangles, multiplying, measuring, closing around him like the bars of a cage made of mathematics.
"I see triangles," Dane said. "White lines. They're not opening. They're closing. They're measuring everything. They're measuring me."
Nikola turned his head. In the other place, the movement was slow, dreamlike, as though the air had become syrup. His eyes found his brother's face. For a moment—for one terrible moment—Dane saw the part of his brother's truth that could not be denied. Not Nikola's face. It wasn't physical. It was the energy, the magnitude of another universe entirely. A presence looking out through the familiar features with an attention that was not human, had never been human, would never be human no matter how long it wore that skin.
Then the vision released them. The midnight blue retreated. The green flakes dissolved. The lines—perpendicular and diagonal, golden and white—faded into the ordinary darkness of a summer evening. The barn roof was solid beneath them. The smell of hay returned. Pasha's tail swished at flies in the pasture below.
"You see triangles," Nikola said. His voice was thoughtful. Curious. Untroubled. "I see squares.""They're the same lines," Dane said.But they were not the same. They had never been the same. Nikola had watched doors open onto cities of light. Dane had been processed. The triangles had moved across him with the patience of a customs official examining cargo—systematic, thorough, indifferent to whether the cargo wanted to be examined. He could still trace the path of their attention. Skull. Spine. The architecture of his joints. The density of what held him together. Everything quantified. Everything recorded. Everything filed under a heading he would never be permitted to read.And behind the measuring, behind the grid, behind the white lines that had caged him while golden squares welcomed his brother—something had looked out through Nikola's face. Something that wore the features of a five-year-old boy the way a hand wears a glove. Comfortable. Practiced. Patient.Nikola tilted his head. The gesture was becoming familiar. The tilt of a physician examining a slide. The angle of a collector assessing a specimen that might or might not be worth keeping."Maybe," Nikola said, "Maybe your eyes are wrong."
The words hung in the air. They hung between the brothers like the geometry that had just released them. Same blood. Same affliction. Same phenomenon arriving unbidden, reshaping reality, demanding to be seen. But where Nikola found doors, Dane found cages. Where Nikola felt welcomed home, Dane felt marked for removal.
The golden squares were beautiful. The white triangles were true. And somewhere between beauty and truth, two brothers were learning that love was not enough to share a world.
The Tesla household had three daughters. Milka was the eldest. Angelina came next. Marica was the youngest of the sisters, though still older than Dane. They moved through the house like shadows of their mother—capable, watchful, trained in the quiet competencies that kept a family fed and clothed and sheltered against the mountain winters. The family rarely spoke of them in detail. The brothers were the focus. The brothers were the future. The sisters were the foundation that no one thought to examine.
But in the autumn of eighteen sixty-one, it was Angelina who became essential.
The visions had grown worse. What had once been daily intrusions became hourly interruptions. Nikola would be eating breakfast, and the midnight blue would descend, and his spoon would freeze halfway to his mouth while the perpendicular lines built their geometries behind his eyes. He would be walking to the well, and the green flakes would begin to fall, and he would stand motionless in the yard while chickens pecked around his feet and the bucket dangled forgotten from his hand. The episodes lasted longer now. The recovery took more time. And most troubling of all—Nikola was beginning to lose the boundary between the other place and this one.
"The table is made of light," he told his mother one morning. His voice was calm. His eyes were focused on something that wasn't there. "The wood is just a picture someone painted over the light. If I look hard enough, I can see through it."
Đuka's face went pale. She gripped her son's shoulders and turned him to face her. "The table is wood," she said. "Oak. Cut from the tree behind the church. Your father blessed it when we first put it in this room. Do you remember?"
Nikola blinked. The distance in his eyes flickered, steadied, returned to something like presence. "I remember," he said. But his voice held doubt. His voice held the uncertainty of someone who had been told a fact that contradicted what he had seen with his own eyes.
The sisters watched from the doorway. They had grown accustomed to these moments—the sudden stillnesses, the strange pronouncements, the way their youngest brother seemed to slip between worlds without warning or control. But this was different. This wasn't Nikola freezing and then returning. This was Nikola returning and still not being certain which world was real.
Angelina stepped forward. She was fourteen years old, practical and patient, with her mother's dark eyes and her father's careful logic. She knelt beside her brother. Her hand found his—small fingers wrapped in larger ones, warm skin against skin that had gone cold during the vision.
"Niko," she said. Her voice was gentle but firm. "Look at me. Not through me. At me."
Nikola's eyes found her face. The distant look wavered.
"The table is wood," Angelina said. "This is my hand. The floor beneath your feet is stone. The fire in the hearth is real fire—you can feel its warmth on your cheek. Can you feel it?"
Nikola turned his face toward the hearth. The orange glow played across his features. Something in his expression shifted—the uncertainty giving way to recognition, the doubt dissolving into the simple animal comfort of heat against skin.
"I feel it," he said.
"Good." Angelina squeezed his hand. "When the other place comes, you come back to the fire. You come back to my hand. You come back to things you can touch."
From that day forward, Angelina became Nikola's anchor. When the visions descended, she would appear at his side. When the midnight blue swept across his eyes, she would take his hand and begin naming the world back into existence. The chair. The window. The smell of bread baking. The sound of the cow lowing in the barn. She would speak the inventory of reality until her brother could see it again, until the perpendicular lines faded and the golden cities dissolved and the kitchen became a kitchen once more.
Dane observed these rituals from the doorway. Never from inside the room. Never close enough to be part of the circle that formed around his brother when the visions came.He would stand at the threshold and take inventory of what he was witnessing: Angelina's hand finding Nikola's. Angelina's voice steady and warm, naming the texture of the world until Nikola could believe in it again. The way his brother's eyes would slowly focus, would travel from the middle distance back to the kitchen, back to the family, back to a reality he had never asked to inhabit.Gratitude was part of it. Someone was helping Nikola. Someone had found a method that worked when Dane's own warnings had failed.Relief was part of it. His brother had a way back now. A rope thrown into the well.But gratitude and relief were only the top layer. Beneath them, something with teeth. Because no one had ever offered Dane a hand when the triangles descended. No one had ever spoken the inventory of the real until he could believe in it again. He had learned to claw his own way back—alone, in silence, through methods that left marks.And here was Nikola, receiving gentleness like it was owed to him. Here was Nikola, being guided home by a sister who loved him. And Dane could see—he could always see—the flicker of reluctance when Nikola's eyes finally focused. The disappointment of a child called inside before the game was finished. Nikola had an anchor and did not want one. Dane had no anchor and had learned to survive the drowning alone.
Dane never needed an anchor. When the triangular grid descended on him, when the white lines began their measuring and the cold attention pressed against his skull, Dane fought. He had learned to fight in the months since the aurora—to clench his fists until the nails drew blood, to bite the inside of his cheek until the taste of copper overwhelmed the metallic taste of the vision, to use pain as a lever to pry himself free of the other place's grip. The fighting worked. The fighting always worked. He could shatter the triangles through sheer refusal, could tear himself back to reality by the force of his resistance.
But Nikola didn't resist. Nikola didn't fight. Nikola sank into the visions like a man sinking into a warm bath, and when Angelina pulled him back, there was always a moment—just a moment, but Dane saw it—when disappointment flickered across his brother's face. The disappointment of a child called home from play too early. The reluctance of someone who had been enjoying where they were.
One evening in late autumn, Dane found Nikola alone in the barn. The younger boy was sitting in the hay, his knees drawn to his chest, his eyes fixed on nothing. The stillness hadn't taken him—his posture was too relaxed for that—but something in his expression suggested he was waiting for it. Inviting it.
Dane sat down beside him. Pasha shifted in his stall, hooves scraping against the wooden floor. The horse's eyes found the brothers, tracked them, then returned to whatever vigilance he maintained through the long nights.
"I can teach you," Dane said. His voice was quiet. "How to push them away. How to come back on your own."
Nikola turned his head. The large dark eyes held no fear. No urgency. Only curiosity—the same curiosity that had made him ask who strokes nature's back, that had made him watch the grid building in the sparks from the cat without flinching.
"Why would I want to push them away?" Nikola asked.
The question was simple. Six words. A child's genuine curiosity. And in those six words, the architecture of everything Dane believed about his brother came apart. He had assumed they were the same. Afflicted together. Fighting together. Both trying to claw their way back to the world that made sense. He had built his understanding of Nikola on that foundation—brother in suffering, partner in resistance, fellow prisoner planning escape. The foundation had just crumbled.Nikola wasn't fighting. He Had never been fighting. Nikola looked at the golden cities and the opening doors and the perpendicular lines, and he saw—what? Not invasion. Not violation. Not the cage that Dane saw closing around them both. Home. Nikola saw home.The divide that had always existed between them—that Dane had sensed but never named—tore open in that moment. They shared blood. They shared the affliction. But they did not share its meaning. They were not partners. They were not allies.They were brothers standing on opposite sides of a door, and only one of them wanted it closed
"Because they're not real," Dane said. "Because they take you somewhere else. Because when you're there, you're not here. You're not with us."
Nikola considered this. His head tilted—that gesture, the one that looked like consideration but felt like measurement. "They're real to me," he said. "The cities are real. The light is real. When I'm there, I can see how everything connects. How it all fits together. Here—" He gestured at the barn, at the hay, at the world of wood and straw and animal warmth. "Here I can only see pieces. There, I can see the whole picture."
"The whole picture is a lie." Dane's voice came out harder than he intended. "It's showing you what it wants you to see. It's making you love it so you won't fight when—"
He stopped. He didn't know how to finish the sentence. When what? When the grid finished building? When the triangles completed their measurements? When whatever was using Nikola's eyes to look at the world decided it was finished looking?
"When what?" Nikola asked. The curiosity was genuine. The boy truly didn't understand what Dane was afraid of. The boy couldn't see the cage closing around him because to Nikola, the cage looked like doors opening.
"I don't know," Dane admitted. His hands had clenched into fists. The nails pressed against his palms, not hard enough to draw blood, but hard enough to remind him that he was here, that his body was his own, that the barn and the hay and the horse were real in a way that the other place would never be. "But I know it's not good. I know the triangles are measuring something. I know the grid is building toward something. And I know that whatever it is, you're at the center of it."
Nikola smiled. The expression was gentle, almost pitying—the look of an older child explaining something obvious to a younger one, though the ages were reversed and the older child was the one who didn't understand.
"Maybe the center is where I'm supposed to be," Nikola said.
The words settled between them. They settled like the green flakes that fell through the midnight blue, accumulating in drifts that glowed with their own phosphorescence. Dane looked at his brother—this small, strange, beloved stranger who shared his blood and his affliction but not his interpretation of either—and felt the divide widen.
Nikola didn't want to be saved. Nikola didn't want to fight. Nikola looked at the golden lines and the opening doors and the cities of light, and he saw home.
Dane looked at the same phenomenon and saw invasion.
Same blood. Same visions. Different worlds.
In the stall, Pasha stamped one hoof against the wooden floor. The sound was sharp. Decisive. The sound of something that had reached a conclusion and was waiting for the brothers to catch up. Dane looked at the horse. The horse looked back. And in that dark, intelligent gaze, Dane saw something that might have been agreement.
They were running out of time. The grid was building. The measurements were nearly complete. And the boy who should have been fighting was waiting with open arms for whatever came next.
The months that followed carved grooves into Dane that would never smooth over. Autumn became winter became spring became summer, and with each turning season, the divide widened—not between the brothers' bodies, which still shared a room, still walked the same roads, still breathed the same mountain air—but between their interpretations of what was happening to them. They stood in the same phenomenon and perceived different weather. Dane had begun to carry the sensation of a man standing on a dock, observing a ship pull away with everyone he loved aboard, unable to make them understand that the vessel was taking on water.No one else remembered the yellow sun. Dane had tested this carefully, obliquely, in conversations that seemed innocent. He had asked his mother about the color of summer light. He had asked his father about the hue of the sunset on his wedding day. He had asked the old men in the village about the shade of the sky in their childhoods. Every answer confirmed what his body already carried as truth. The sun had always been white. The amber glow that Dane remembered—the honey-colored mornings that had pooled in the valley before the aurora, the afternoons that had felt like being held inside something golden—existed only in his memory. And memory, he was learning, was the loneliest country a person could inhabit.The Arabian's focus on Nikola had thickened through the winter. No longer simple observation—this was something denser. Pasha would orient toward the younger boy's path across the yard, would position himself where Nikola's movements could not escape his notice, would test the air each time the boy passed as though reading invisible script. What the Arabian carried in his gaze was older than fear, steadier than aggression. It was the patience of oak roots pressing through stone—not hurried, not hungry, simply inevitable. The patience of a creature that had found its post and would not abandon it. Dane recognized the quality because he felt it in himself: the weight of watching, the burden of remembering, the quiet determination to hold vigil over a threshold that others could not see.When Dane groomed him in the evenings, running the brush along the muscled neck, he could feel the patience humming beneath the coat like a second heartbeat. Pasha was waiting. Not for prey. For proof. For the moment when the thing he sensed in Nikola would finally show itself clearly enough that even those who had forgotten how to see would have to look.
Dane noticed the pattern. When Nikola walked near the pasture fence, Pasha would drift toward him, closing the distance without seeming to move. When Nikola's voice carried across the yard, Pasha's ears would swivel like dishes tracking a signal. And on the days when the visions took Nikola—when the midnight blue descended and the boy froze in whatever position the other place had caught him—Pasha would stand motionless, watching, as though the horse could see what was happening behind those distant eyes.
The cold breath had not returned. After that first encounter in the pasture, Pasha had been careful around Nikola. Careful and attentive and horribly, horribly interested. Dane groomed the horse every day, and every day he searched the dark eyes for some explanation. The bond between them remained strong. The recognition remained. But now there was something else beneath it—a divided loyalty that Dane could feel like a splinter working its way toward his heart.
"What are you waiting for?" Dane whispered one evening, his brush moving down Pasha's flank in long, steady strokes. "What do you see when you look at him?"
The horse turned his head. The dark eyes met Dane's. And for a moment, the boy thought he saw an answer forming—some communication that the animal was struggling to translate into a language that human minds could understand. Then the moment passed. Pasha returned to his hay. The silence filled the stable like water filling a basin. Whatever the horse knew, it was not ready to share.
Summer arrived in eighteen sixty-two with a heat that pressed down on the valley like a hand. The nights brought little relief. The air remained thick and still, heavy with moisture that refused to fall as rain. Dane had taken to sleeping on the barn roof—the highest point on the property, where occasional breezes could reach him and where the darkness felt less like a blanket and more like a space he could breathe in.
On a night in late July, he climbed to his usual perch and lay on his back, staring upward. The stars were sharp. The moon had not yet risen. The Milky Way stretched across the sky like a river of spilled light, and Dane let his eyes follow its course from horizon to horizon. This, at least, had not changed. The stars were still the stars. The constellations held their ancient shapes. Whatever had rewritten the sun had left the night sky intact.
Then his eyes adjusted. The deep darkness between the stars resolved into something that was not quite black. Dane blinked. He rubbed his eyes. He looked again. The color was still there. A deep, rich, velvety blue that filled the spaces where pure darkness should have been. Midnight blue. The same shade that swept across his vision when the other place descended. The same color that heralded the green flakes and the geometric lines.
The night sky was not black. The night sky had never been black. Children saw this—infants staring at the ceiling in the hours before dawn, toddlers pointing at the darkness between the stars and trying to name what they were seeing. But adults forgot. Adults learned to see black because black was simpler, because black was what the new light insisted upon, because black required no explanation and no memory and no uncomfortable questions about what else might have been edited from perception.
Dane sat up. His heart was hammering against his ribs. He looked at the village below—the dark shapes of houses, the darker bulk of his father's church, the scattered points of light where candles still burned behind shuttered windows. Every adult in those houses looked at this same sky and saw nothing. Every adult had learned to unsee the blue that Dane could still perceive.
How long did he have? How many more summers before his eyes adjusted, before his brain completed the calibration, before he joined the rest of humanity in the comfortable blindness that passed for normal vision? The thought made his stomach clench. The thought made him want to tear at his own eyes, to damage them in some way that would prevent the adjustment, to preserve through violence what the grid was slowly erasing through patience.
He stayed on the roof until dawn. He watched the midnight blue fade as the white sun climbed above the mountains. He watched the color drain from the sky like blood draining from a wound, leaving behind the pale emptiness that everyone else called morning. And he understood, with a clarity that felt like grief, that he was watching his own extinction. Not the death of his body. The death of his capacity to see what was being taken.
Below, in the yard, Nikola emerged from the house. The boy was six years old now, small for his age, moving with the distracted grace of someone whose attention was always partly elsewhere. Dane watched his brother walk toward the well. Watched the small hands lower the bucket. Watched the ordinary motions of an ordinary morning and felt the distance between them stretch into something that could not be measured in feet or meters.
Nikola looked up. His eyes found Dane on the roof. The boy smiled—a genuine smile, warm and untroubled, the smile of a brother greeting a brother on a summer morning. Dane raised his hand in response. The gesture felt hollow. The gesture felt like waving to someone on the deck of a ship that was already too far out to reach.
They loved each other. This was the cruelest part. They loved each other with the fierce, uncomplicated love of brothers who had shared a room since birth, who had played the same games and feared the same thunderstorms and been comforted by the same mother's hands. The love was real. The love was undiminished. But love, Dane was learning, did not guarantee understanding. Love did not bridge the gap between perpendicular lines and diagonal ones. Love did not make two people see the same world when the world itself had been fractured into incompatible versions.
Nikola returned to the house with his bucket of water. Dane climbed down from the roof and went to feed Pasha. The morning continued. The summer continued. The slow accumulation of days that would lead, eventually, to something that neither brother could prevent.In the pasture, the Arabian raised his head. Pasha's ears had already swiveled toward the footsteps before Dane emerged from the tree line. The muscles along the horse's neck shifted, rebalanced, oriented—every line of that dark body realigning toward a single point of focus. The nostrils flared once, twice, pulling information from the evening air. Then the tension drained from the hindquarters like water finding its level.Dane's shoulders dropped the moment the horse found him. An automatic release. His breath came easier. His stride lengthened. He hadn't realized how tightly he'd been carrying himself until the sight of Pasha unwound something that had been coiled behind his ribs since morning.But Pasha's attention had not been on Dane alone.The horse had been tracking Nikola's path to the house, and that tracking carried a different quality entirely. Dane had observed it from the tree line—the way Pasha's body gathered itself when turned toward the smaller brother. The ears locked forward like weapons trained on a target. The nostrils working in slow, deliberate pulls, sampling the atmosphere around Nikola for something that didn't belong. The muscles beneath the dark coat collecting into readiness. Not aggression. Something more careful than that. The coiled stillness of a sentry monitoring a boundary he cannot name but knows by instinct must not be crossed.Now, with Nikola safely inside the house, every indicator reversed. The ears rotated toward Dane like compass needles finding true north. The gathered muscles released their tension. The breath that had been held shallow and frequent slowed into the deep rhythm of a creature that has, for this moment, found something it can trust.This was how it had become between them. A language older than words, assembled from a thousand small moments of mutual recognition. Dane would find Pasha stationed between the barn and the house—always positioned where he could monitor Nikola's movements without approaching, always carrying himself with the rigid attention of a sentry who has identified a threat but cannot communicate it to his commanders. The Arabian would hold that posture for hours. Dane had timed it. The focus never wavered. The alertness never softened. Whatever Pasha perceived in Nikola, it demanded constant surveillance—the kind of vigilance that hollows out the body, that costs something each minute it is maintained. Dane could see the toll in the horse's flanks, leaner now than they had been in spring. In the way Pasha's coat had lost some of its luster, the body diverting resources from beauty to endurance. But when Dane appeared, the cost reversed.The horse's entire bearing would shift—a visible exhale, a loosening of the jaw, a settling of the hindquarters that communicated more clearly than any human language could have managed. You are still here. You still remember. We are still holding the line together. Something in Dane's own body answered. A knot behind his sternum that he carried everywhere—through breakfast, through chores, through the long hours of pretending nothing was wrong—would loosen when Pasha's attention found him. Not dissolve. The knot never dissolved anymore. But it would ease enough that Dane could breathe without the breath catching on its edges. Enough that he could remember what it had been like, before, to simply exist without the constant weight of knowing.Pasha knew what Dane perceived. Not through shared visions—Dane had no evidence that the horse experienced the geometric invasions, the blue darkness, the triangular lines that measured and catalogued. But the Arabian recognized the presence threading itself through Nikola's nervous system. Recognized it and refused to accommodate. Every other creature in the valley had adjusted.The dogs that once followed Nikola everywhere now circled wide around him—but they did so absently, the avoidance of animals that have forgotten why they avoid. They had incorporated the new pattern into their instincts without questioning the change, the way a stream incorporates a fallen log: routing around it, forgetting there was ever a time when the water flowed differently. The cats ignored Nikola with the studied indifference of creatures that have decided a thing is not worth investigating. The chickens scattered when he approached, but chickens scattered for everyone. Even the humans had accommodated. Milutin's initial wariness had smoothed into routine concern, the sharp edges of his questions worn down by repetition until they no longer cut. Đuka's worried glances had faded into the background hum of maternal attention, indistinguishable from her worry about weather or illness or whether the firewood would last the winter. The sisters treated their brother's strangeness as simply another fact of household life, like the leak in the roof or the draft beneath the door—present, acknowledged, not worth discussing. But Pasha remembered.The horse tracked Nikola with the sustained attention of a creature that knows exactly why it is wary and refuses to let that knowledge be edited away. Whatever process was rewriting the instincts of every other animal in the valley, whatever was smoothing the rough edges of human memory until the wrongness became invisible—it had not reached Pasha. Or Pasha had rejected it. Or Pasha possessed some quality that made him incompatible with the revision. Dane did not know which explanation was true. He only knew that his horse's continued vigilance was the only anchor he had left. The only proof that the world had changed and someone besides Dane had noticed. The only other heartbeat in the valley that still carried the rhythm of the original timeline, the one that everyone else seemed to have forgotten had ever existed.
The days accumulated like sediment. Layer upon layer of small moments—breakfast, chores, the angle of the sun through the kitchen window—each one ordinary, each one resting on a foundation that was quietly being hollowed out beneath them. Dane's body knew what was coming before his mind could name it. The knowledge arrived in fragments: a tightness in the throat that appeared each morning and deepened by evening, as if something were slowly closing around his windpipe. A pressure behind his temples that had nothing to do with lack of sleep—the skull's way of registering atmospheric changes that hadn't reached the skin yet. The way his hands would sometimes tremble when he reached for ordinary objects—a cup, a bridle, his brother's shoulder—as if the muscles themselves were uncertain whether the thing they reached for would still be solid when they made contact.The structure was thinning. He could sense it the way a man crossing ice senses the moment before the crack—not through any visible evidence, but through some ancient calibration of the inner ear, some inherited wisdom that reads the micro-flexions of a surface about to fail. Each ordinary day added its mass to the accumulation. Each breakfast, each chore, each angle of light pressing down on a span that was no longer engineered to bear such loads.Dane's joints registered the approach first. A leaden ache settled into his knees and wrists—the body's way of preparing for impact, pulling resources toward the places that would need to absorb the fall. His sleep had fractured into shallow intervals broken by the certainty that he had missed something, that the important moment had happened while his attention wandered. His appetite had thinned to a perfunctory intake of fuel, the body conserving resources for a crisis it could not name but had already begun to prepare for. Dane did not know what form it would take. He only knew it was approaching the way the body knows fever before the thermometer confirms—that interior alarm, older than language, that pulls the blood toward the core and tells the animal: brace yourself. The hours ahead will be different from the hours behind.Pasha carried the same knowledge in his bones. Dane recognized it in the horse's positioning—the way the Arabian stationed himself each morning at the precise midpoint between barn and house, the geometry of his stance calculated to maintain clear sightlines to both structures. The way those dark hooves never fully settled into the grass, the hindquarters never fully released into rest, the entire architecture of muscle and bone held in a state of readiness that could become motion within a single heartbeat. A guardian's stance. Not the rigid alertness of fear, but the composed readiness of acceptance.Pasha could not stop what was building. They both understood this. Whatever was threading itself through Nikola's nervous system, whatever was spreading through the spaces between stars and colonizing the minds of everyone who failed to notice the change—no horse, however loyal, however perceptive, could stand against it. The opposition of a single animal against the rewiring of reality was not a battle. It was barely even a gesture. But it was the gesture Pasha had chosen to make.Each day that the Arabian held his position—stationed between the structures, balanced for movement, refusing to abandon his vigil even when the vigil could accomplish nothing—was a day that Dane was not alone in his resistance. Each day the horse maintained his sentry's stance was a day that someone besides Dane acknowledged: this is happening. This is wrong. This deserves to be witnessed, even if witnessing is all we can do.Pasha could not prevent what was coming. He could only refuse to pretend it wasn't approaching. The family horse that claimed Dane as his could only hold his ground while the ground itself was being rewritten beneath him. It was, Dane understood, the most any of them could offer. The only defiance left to those who had already lost the war and were simply choosing how to meet the defeat. Not with denial. Not with accommodation. But with open awareness—the stubborn, useless, necessary act of standing present while the world they knew was slowly replaced by something wearing its shape.
The summer of eighteen sixty-three arrived with a gentleness that felt like apology. The heat was softer than the year before. The rains came when they were needed. The crops grew tall and green in fields that had been grey with exhaustion. If Dane had believed in omens, he might have taken the mild weather as a sign that the worst had passed. But Dane no longer believed in omens. Dane believed only in what he could see, and what he could see was a world slowly losing its ability to see itself.
On an evening in late June, the brothers walked home together from the village. Nikola had been visiting a schoolmate—one of the few children in Smiljan who didn't cross the street when the Tesla boys approached. Dane had waited outside, watching the shadows lengthen across the cobblestones, listening to the sounds of ordinary life continuing in houses where no one saw grids or tasted metal or woke in the night with the sensation of being measured. The ordinary world. The edited world. The world that had forgotten what it used to be.
Nikola emerged as the sun touched the mountains. The boy was seven years old now, still small, still carrying that quality of attention that made people uneasy without understanding why. But this evening his face held something simpler. Happiness. The uncomplicated happiness of a child who had spent an afternoon playing games that had nothing to do with visions or geometry or the space between worlds.
"Race you to the bridge," Nikola said. Dane smiled. The expression felt unfamiliar on his face—a muscle memory from a time before the weight had settled on his shoulders. "You'll lose."
"I always lose." Nikola said, already running. "That's not the point Niko." Dane smiled. They ran. The road unspooled beneath their feet, packed earth still warm from the day's sun. The air smelled of hay and wildflowers and the distant promise of rain. Dane's longer legs carried him ahead, but he slowed at the bridge, letting Nikola catch up, letting the boy arrive breathless and laughing and flushed with the simple joy of movement.They walked the rest of the way together. The dusk settled around them like a familiar blanket. The first stars were appearing above the mountains, faint pricks of light in a sky that was deepening from gold to rose to purple. Dane let his attention drift upward. Not aimed. Not searching. Just... lifted, like a hand opening after hours of gripping a blade handle. The colors moved through their ancient sequence—gold bleeding into rose, rose deepening into purple—and for once, he simply received them. No assessment. No cataloguing. No calculation of what the shifting light might mean or what might be hiding inside it. It was a small thing. A dangerous thing.For months, Dane's awareness had been a weapon—aimed constantly at Nikola's face, searching for the micro-expressions that signaled the other presence surfacing. Aimed at the horizon, scanning for the return of the red light. Aimed at every shadow, every sound, every shift in the ordinary texture of daily life, cataloguing anomalies in a world that produced them faster than Dane could record. His perception had become a sentry that never stood down. His consciousness had become a logbook that never closed. the cost had written itself into his body.A permanent tension in the muscles around Dane's eyes—the tiny fibers that control focus, that direct the lens, that had spent so many hours locked in close-range threat assessment that they had forgotten how to soften. A tightness in his jaw from teeth held perpetually ready to clench against the visions when they came. The dull ache across Dane's shoulders where the posture of alertness had calcified into the posture of exhaustion. Dane had not slept through a full night since September. He had not looked at anything—truly looked, the way a child looks, with curiosity instead of calculation—since before the red sky taught him that beauty could be a mask for invasion. But this—the gold bleeding into rose, the rose deepening to purple, the first stars emerging like old friends who had never stopped visiting even when he had forgotten to look up—this was not assessment.This was wonder. The old wonder. The kind that had lived in him before the aurora, before the geometry, before his little brother Nikola became a threshold that kept swinging open onto rooms Dane could not enter and did not want to see. The sky was still beautiful. The colors still moved through their ancient sequence, indifferent to whatever was building itself in the spaces between stars. This, at least, had not been taken. This, at least, was still his to receive. The muscles around his eyes softened. The jaw unclenched. The shoulders, just slightly, released their grip on his spine. Dane let himself breathe. He let himself be a boy walking home with his brother in the summer dusk. He let himself forget, for the length of three heartbeats, that forgetting was dangerous"I visited the cities again last night," Nikola said. His voice was casual. Conversational. The voice of a boy discussing something as ordinary as breakfast or weather. "The towers were taller this time. The light was brighter." Nikola's small hand swung at his side as he walked, keeping rhythm with his steps. His face was open, untroubled, lit by the dying gold of the sunset. "I think they're building new things. For when I come back. They showed me where my room will be."Three heartbeats. That was all Dane had been given. The colors were still there—gold bleeding into rose, rose deepening into purple—but they had stopped landing. The visual information reached Dane and died somewhere before it could become meaning. The sky was just a sky again. The dusk was just the hour before night.The body walking beside him was just the chassis his brother had been born into—the vehicle temporarily unoccupied while the passenger was elsewhere, touring its future accommodations in a city that had no coordinates on any map Dane could read. "They showed me where my room will be." Those words circled in Dane's skull like birds that couldn't find a place to land. Nikola had a room waiting for him. In the other place. The place that wasn't here, that had never been here, that was slowly building itself a doorway through the nervous system of a boy who spoke of towers and light the way other children spoke of games and playmates. The muscles around his eyes re-engaged. The jaw re-clenched. The shoulders re-gathered their grip on his spine.The burden hadn't lifted during those three heartbeats. Dane understood that now. The burden had simply continued its work while his attention was elsewhere—the way a tumor continues growing whether you think about it or not. The respite hadn't been relief. It had been distraction. And now the distraction was over, and he could feel the full accumulated mass of everything he carried pressing down through the architecture of his skeleton—shoulders, spine, hips, knees—three heartbeats heavier than before. Three heartbeats closer to the moment when the structure would fail."You shouldn't go there so often." Dane said. He heard his own voice from a distance—a sound arriving from somewhere outside his body, somewhere that had learned to speak without consulting the rest of him. "You spend more time in the other place than you spend here."Nikola looked up at him. The large dark pupils held no defensiveness, no guilt. Only the mild confusion of a child who has been told to stop doing something he doesn't understand is wrong."But I like it there," he said. "They're waiting for me. They're always waiting."The last light bled from the sky. The stars emerged, one by one, into a darkness that was no longer simply the absence of light but the presence of something vast and patient and increasingly interested in the small figures walking home through the summer dusk. Dane said nothing. There was nothing to say. His brother had a room in a city that shouldn't exist, and the builders were waiting, and every night the construction continued, and every morning Nikola woke up a little more fluent in a language Dane couldn't hear."We don't belong there Niko. We belong here." Dane said.
"It's happening to both of us Dane. Maybe here isn't where we're supposed to be." Nikola looked up at his brother. The large dark eyes held no challenge, no defiance. Only the simple statement of something the boy believed to be true. The two brothers reached the yard. Nikola ran ahead into the house, following the smell of dinner and the sound of their mother's voice. Dane stood silently, watching his brother disappear, feeling the distance between them stretch into something that could not be measured.
Pasha had come to the fence. The horse stood without moving—his coat so close to the color of the dusk that he seemed less like an animal and more like a hole in the evening, a place where the fading sky simply stopped and depth began. Only the shine along his orbital ridges betrayed him. Two crescents of reflected twilight, fixed on the door through which Nikola had disappeared.The Arabian held that focus until the latch clicked. Until the rectangle of lamplight from the doorway narrowed to a sliver and then vanished. Pasha's great head turned, and focused on Dane. Dane crossed the yard. His fingers found the velvet of Pasha's muzzle, and the heat that meant alliance rose to meet his skin—the specific temperature of a creature that has chosen you, that would stand between you and whatever came through the shadows. But beneath that familiar heat, a second current ran. A resonance. The particular frequency of two minds tuned to the same dread, picking up the same signal that everyone else had learned to ignore."You see it too." the eldest boy said to his horse. His voice came out barely louder than breathing. The words were meant for the horse alone. "You see what's building behind his eyes. What's looking out through him." The exhale that answered him carried the scent of hay and the particular musk of an animal that has been standing in one place for a long time, waiting.
